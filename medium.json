Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/10."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <24216240.1075855687451.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 12 Apr 2018 03:00:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: leah.arsdall@enron.com\nSubject: Re: test\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Leah Van Arsdall\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\ntest successful.  way to go!!!", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/100."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <13505866.1075863688222.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 4 Jan 2018 06:13:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: randall.gay@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Randall L Gay\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nRandy,\n\n Can you send me a schedule of the salary and level of everyone in the \nscheduling group.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/118."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <10523086.1075855687873.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 10 Jan 2018 07:01:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 \n02:00 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\tReschedule\nChairperson: Richard Burchfield\nSent by: Cindy Cicchetti\n\nStart: 10/03/2000 02:30 PM\nEnd: 10/03/2000 03:30 PM\n\nDescription: Gas Physical/Financail Positions -

Now or for the land closing? Investment \nschedule?\n\n Investment Return\n\n Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?\n\n Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits \nare distributed?\n\n Debt\n\n Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral \nis associated with each \n loan?\n\n Improvement\n\n Construction\n\n Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.\n\n Terms of each loan?\n\n Uses of Funds\n\n How will disbursements be made?  By whom?\n\n What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing \nfor investors?\n\n Reports to track expenses vs plan?\n\n Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\n\n What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get \npaid a markup on subcontractors as a \n general contractor and paid gain out of profits?\n\n Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses \nbefore the ultimate payout of profits?\n\n Design and Construction\n \n When will design be complete?\n\n What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?\n\n What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction \nplanning and permitting?\n\n Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, \nvendors, and other professionals? \n Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?\n\n Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to \nuse? Names?\n\nThese questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor \nin a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as\nmuch as possible from the process.\n\nPhillip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n ", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/130."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <32280829.1075855688139.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 14 Jan 2018 09:35:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: pallen70@hotmail.com\nSubject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: pallen70@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000 \n04:35 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> \nSubject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls\n\n\nEnclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin\nthat we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.

Exodus is now wrapping up \nconstruction\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \na mile from its\n                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \nfiber optic backbones, the\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \neventually\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \n\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \ncenters near Seattle.\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \nGlobix and\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \nthe networking\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \n\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \neverything from your\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \nyour favorite Web sites.\n\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \nserver farms, are\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \nValley that some\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \nPuget Sound\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \nhigh-security\n                  facilities. \n\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \nare requesting 445\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \nsaid Karl\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \nEnergy. \"That is\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \n\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \nthe rise of the Internet\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \nheads. \n\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \nUtilities and\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \ndata centers. The\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing \nresidential and business\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \nnecessary to support\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \nmillion each,\n                  Karzmar said. \n\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \nbring up the data center\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \n\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \nbusinesses and schools in the\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \n\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \nappetite for power --\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \nfacilities run 24 hours a\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \nconstant revenue\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \nthey could\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \nexpenditures. \n\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \nmean for power rates\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \n\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \nCity Light. \n\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \nlights at the football\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \nWe have data\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \nand 50 megawatts.\" \n\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \ncomplex in Tukwila is\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \nthe 1.35 million\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \nBoeing Space &\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \n92 percent of the\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \ncompanies. \n\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \nCommunications,\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \nNetworks all\n                  lease space in the office park. \n\n                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \nSabey has become an\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \nmanagement or\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \nclaims his firm is\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \nthe country. \n\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \nbandwidth-heavy tasks\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \nco-location space in\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \n\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \nspace is growing at a\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \ncausing similar\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \nCalifornia. \n\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \nspace, plans to nearly\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \nWhile companies\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \nhigh-tech companies\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \nas Exodus that\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \nmanagement. \n\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \nconstruction and we plan to\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \ndemand right now\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \nexecutive at Exodus in\n                  Seattle. \n\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \nin the local utility\n                  industry perplexed. \n\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \nto serve the growth,\"\n                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is \nalmost stunned by this, in\n                  a way.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/151."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <28100251.1075855688597.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 21 Feb 2018 03:46:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: Re:\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nIna,\n\n Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance \nreviews from H.R.\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000 \n10:44 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nJohn J Lavorato@ENRON\n09/06/2000 05:39 AM\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re:  \n\nThe commercial support people that you and Hunter want to make commercial \nmanagers.  \n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/152."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <2291003.1075855688619.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 4 Apr 2018 23:22:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: john.lavorato@enron.com\nSubject: Re:\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: John J Lavorato\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nresumes of whom?", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/153."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <17954197.1075855688641.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 4 Jan 2018 06:51:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence\n Program\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 \n01:50 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"Christi Smith\" <christi.smith@lrinet.com> on 09/05/2000 11:40:59 AM\nPlease respond to <christi.smith@lrinet.com>\nTo: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Debbie Nowak (E-mail)\" <dnowak@enron.com> \nSubject: RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence \nProgram\n\n\nWe have not received your completed Team Selection information.

To me this \nlooks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, \nTosco, and SLB?\n\n\nThank you,\n\n Phillip\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/180."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <4511963.1075855689223.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 18 Feb 2018 10:39:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: pallen70@hotmail.com\nSubject: Daily Duties\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: pallen70@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 08/20/2000 \n05:39 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"Lucy Gonzalez\" <stagecoachmama@hotmail.com> on 08/15/2000 02:32:57 PM\nTo: pallen@enron.com\ncc:  \nSubject: Daily Duties\n\n\n\n      Phillip,\n           We have been working on different apartments today and having to\nlisten to different, people about what Mary is saying should i be worried?\nants seem to be invading my apartment.You got my other fax's Wade is working\non the bulletin board that I need up so that I can let tenants know about\nwhat is going on.Gave #25 a notice about having to many people staying in\nthat apt and that problem has been resolved.Also I have a tenant in #29 that\nis complaining about #28 using fowl language.I sent #28 a lease violation we\nwill see how that goes\n                                                  call you tomorrow\n                                           Thanx Lucy\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/181."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <33111317.1075855689245.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 25 Mar 2018 10:39:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: pallen70@hotmail.com\nSubject: Daily Report\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: pallen70@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 08/20/2000 \n05:38 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"Lucy Gonzalez\" <stagecoachmama@hotmail.com> on 08/16/2000 02:44:36 PM\nTo: pallen@enron.com\ncc:  \nSubject: Daily Report\n\n\n\n       Phillip,\n               The a/c I bought today for #17 cost $166.71 pd by ck#1429\n      8/16/00 at WAL-MART.Also on 8/15/00 Ralph's Appliance Centerck#1428\n      frig & stove for apt #20-B IVOICE # 000119 AMT=308.56 (STOVE=150.00\n     (frig=125.00)DEL CHRG=15.00\\TAX=18.56 TOTAL=308.56.FAX MACHINE FOR\nFFICE CK # 1427=108.25 FROM sTEELMAN OFFICE PRODUC\n\nTS.

He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.\n\nOn another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.

 If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS \ninformation, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed \nas soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days \nago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to \ncall Ted Bland @ 3-5275.\n\nWith Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees \nbetween operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to \nhave one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee \ndata.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the \nyear-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC \nrequests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their \nprofiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education \nneed to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is \naccessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to \nhrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com \non the command line of your browser.\n\nThe target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would \nlike to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned \nfor input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please \ncontact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  \n\nYour  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   \n\n\nThanks,\n\n\nDave", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/235."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <29996655.1075855690416.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 14 Jan 2018 09:40:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com\nSubject: West Power Strategy Materials\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 06/27/2000 \n04:39 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nTIM HEIZENRADER\n06/27/2000 11:35 AM\nTo: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: West Power Strategy Materials\n\nCharts for today's meeting are attached: \n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/236."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <32005218.1075855690438.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 14 Jan 2018 05:33:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: kenneth.shulklapper@enron.com\nSubject: gas storage model\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Kenneth Shulklapper\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 06/27/2000 \n12:32 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nZimin Lu\n06/14/2000 07:09 AM\nTo: Mark Breese/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Colleen \nSullivan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Hunter S Shively/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K \nAllen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jim Schwieger/HOU/ECT@ECT, \nScott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: gas storage model\n\n\nMark,\n\nWe are currently back-testing the storage model. \nThe enclosed version contains deltas and decision \nvariable. \n\nYou mentioned that you have resources to run the model.

The \nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their \ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \nthe generation side.\n\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \nthey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\n\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \nothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas \ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \nespecially compared to all gas consumption.

The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.\n\nBid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \nI'll take care of it..\n\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \n$235,019.   \n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \nGDP-Kingsgate.\n\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \ncase there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the \nvolumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. \n \nDeal #  251327                  159540                   265229         \n106300   201756\nP&L  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199)          \n($2,769)   ($273)\nRec:   Ques/Clay Basin/0184   NWPL/Opal 543  NWPL/Opal   Sumas      NWPL/S of \nGr Rvr\nDel:   NWPL/S of Green River/Clay   Ques/Clay Basin/0852   Ques/Clay \nBasin/0852   Ques/Clay Basin    Ques/Clay Basin\n1        329       8,738\n2     1,500\n3         2,974    11,362\n4         6,741    12,349       1,439\n5       19,052          3,183\n9            333\n13  30,863       2,680\n14  30,451    \n15  35,226    \n16         6,979              235 \n17  17,464     \n18    9,294     \n20  10,796          771\n21  17,930     \n22  10,667     \n23       14,415          9,076\n25  23,934       8,695\n26     3,284     \n27         1,976\n28     1,751     \n29     1,591     \n30  20,242     \n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/254."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <18351800.1075855690826.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 26 Mar 2018 07:19:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: maryrichards7@hotmail.com\nSubject: Re: balance on truck/loan\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: \"mary richards\" <maryrichards7@hotmail.com> @ ENRON\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nMary,\n\nIf we add both balances together the total is $1,140.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.

They were polite regarding \nasset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to \nlisten to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to \nprotect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality \nagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable \nus to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder \nvalue by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by \nreducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a \nweather product.\n\nAs to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other \ncandidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy \nto ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our \nopportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we \nimplement our strategy in California.\n\nAre there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset \nmanagement deal that we should approach?

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/266."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <12747549.1075855691087.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 17 Jan 2018 06:40:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: hargr@webtv.net\nSubject: Re: #30\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: hargr@webtv.net (Neal Hargrove) @ ENRON\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nKay & Neal,\n\nThanks for remembering my birthday.

Any possibility for a \ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \ndifficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \ndisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the \ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should \nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \n \nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n \nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\nCurrent Projected \nBlended IR:  5.38%\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\n\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \nidea  earlier in the crisis.\n \nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/353."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <14983560.1075855723797.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 9 Apr 2018 05:18:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com, \n\tjane.tholt@enron.com, jay.reitmeyer@enron.com, \n\ttori.kuykendall@enron.com, matthew.lenhart@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power Conf.

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook \nclient will be configured on your computer.\nAfter migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail \nvia Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is \nconfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is \nmigrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your \nweb browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and \nTo-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook \nclient is configured on your desktop.\n\n2.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that \nthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large \npart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which \nthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman \nbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \nanswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \nsome enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \ndemand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \nexport California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty \nstrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \nout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \nif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \nagenda.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \ncompared with the previous year.\n\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\n\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \nquestions or need any further information.\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/400."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <25215661.1075855724837.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 9 Mar 2018 07:39:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLucy,\n\nHere is the rentroll from last friday.  \n\nThe closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday \nApril 20th.

Center Garage\n\nThe Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.\n\nEmployees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new \nbuilding and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being \noffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.\n\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \nemployee cost of $94.00.\n\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \nas spaces become available. \n\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \n\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \ngarage.\n\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \n\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/412."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <94904.1075855725132.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 12 Apr 2018 05:52:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: pallen70@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: pallen70@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nhttps://www4.rsweb.com/61045/", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/413."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <17997163.1075855725155.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 2 Apr 2018 04:01:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jacquestc@aol.com\nSubject: Re:\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: JacquesTC@aol.com @ ENRON\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nJacques\n\nI am out of the office for the rest of the week.

Any experience with FHA \n221(d) loans?  \n\nAlthough your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market \nquotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:\n\n  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment\n  2%- overhead\n  4%- profit\n\nI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an \nextremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even \nreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only \ngenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about \nsuch a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down \nto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?\n\nI realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you \nlocal connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of \nthe office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.\n\nPhillip\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/415."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <8520345.1075855725198.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 9 Feb 2018 02:19:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: scfatkfa@caprock.net\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: scfatkfa@caprock.net\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nCary,\n\nHere is the picture of the house I have in mind.

Below is a \nlist of questions on the specs:\n\n1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less \nand cost about the same?\n\n2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory \njoist?\n\n3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?\n\n4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What \ntype of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or \nCellulose?\n\n5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?\n\n6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know \nthe difference between an apron and a stool.\n\n7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent \ncracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?\n\n8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial \none out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.\n\n9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under \nthe stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.\n\n10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount \nstainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.\n\n11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.\n\n12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?\n\n13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?\n\n14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron \nrailings?\n\n15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except \nfor change orders?\n\nI want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but \nthis is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to \ncall Cary Kipp to\nsee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.\n\nPhillip\nI\n\n ", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/421."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <24824079.1075855725330.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 1 Feb 2018 04:43:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: llewter@austin.rr.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: llewter@austin.rr.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLarry,\n\nJacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.

You mentioned 2% \noverhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.\n\nWhy is profit only 4%? \n\nWhy are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.\n\nWhat is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to \nboost loan amount but not a real cost?\n\nTotal Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who \nreceives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?\n\nWhere is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?\n\nWhat is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts \nNOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% \nexpenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.

My only comment is that George and Larry might \nobject to the language that \"the bank that was requested to finance the \nconstruction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs \nof the construction of the Project\".   Technically, that bank lowered the \nloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of \nequity that would be required. \n\nDid I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.\n\nRegarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, \nengineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are \nin a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking \ndirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on \nwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  \n\nThe obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we \nneed to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and \ngive consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/432."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <4296279.1075855725567.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 2 Jan 2018 02:03:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: keith.holst@enron.com, mike.grigsby@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com\nSubject: Current Gas Desk List\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Keith Holst, Mike Grigsby, Frank Ermis\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/26/2001 \n10:03 AM ---------------------------\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Current Gas Desk List\n\nHope this helps!

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is \nstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot \nand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a \ntopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to \ncoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the \nsmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going \nto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to \ncomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which \n$14,000 are due now for work completed.  \n\nWe are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by \nthe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can \ncontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's \nnumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and \nask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call \nand he was fine with that.  \n\nNow we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp \nFlores can be used.\n\nKeith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very \noptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.\n\nCall me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about \nmoving this project forward.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/452."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <32121621.1075855726001.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 26 Feb 2018 03:49:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jacquestc@aol.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Jacquestc@aol.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nHere is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.

I don't believe the architect \nwork will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation \nfor their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were \nproposing was unsupportable by the market.  \n\nMy version of a buyout is attached.\n\nI need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to \nforeclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  \nSince their cost\nand fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I \nwouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I \nwant to respond to their offer asap.\n\nCall me with your thoughts.\n\nPhillip\n\n\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/14/2001 \n08:36 AM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 03/13/2001 11:29:49 PM\nPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nTo: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>, \"Keith Holst\" <kholst@enron.com>\ncc: \"Larry Lewter\" <LLEWTER@austin.rr.com>, \"Claudia L.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \n500+\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \nthis,\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\n\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\n\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\n\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\n\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\nturn over.\n\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\n\n4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \ndebt\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\n\n5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\n\n6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\nequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\n\n     Land -                   $1,121,670\n     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\n     Cash Equity              $1,419,268\n     Total                    $2,955,938\n\n7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage \nof\nactual hard construction costs.\n\n(See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)\n\n\n\n\n - MAPTTRA.xls\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/460."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <32606432.1075855726188.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 18 Mar 2018 08:16:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: djack@keyad.com\nSubject: Re: San Marcos\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: \"Darrell Jack\" <djack@keyad.com> @ ENRON\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nDarrell,\n\nToday I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his \nexcessively high cost estimates.

He \nfeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  \nWe would not even be able to cover the interim financing.\n\nKeith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we \ncannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   \nWe would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.\n\nPhillip \n\n  \n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/470."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <16336441.1075855726417.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 6 Feb 2018 05:54:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jim123@pdq.net\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: jim123@pdq.net\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/05/2001 \n01:59 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Phillip K Allen                           03/05/2001 10:37 AM\n\t\n\nTo: jim123@pdq.net\ncc:  \nSubject: \n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/471."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <24210844.1075855726439.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 28 Jan 2018 03:16:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: angela.collins@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Insight Hardware\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Angela Collins\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nI have not received the aircard 300 yet.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/472."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <30625995.1075855726460.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 30 Jan 2018 01:38:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: don.black@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Producer Services\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Don Black\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nDon,\n\nI was out last week.

Also, the trim material and labor costs\nhave been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than\nsufficient, but there will be additional updates.\n\nThe manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N\ntotal of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and\noffice is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as\na rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.\n\nThe financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent\nmortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the\nconstruction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this\nloan is obtained.\n\nBased on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the\nconstruction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.\n\nGeorge W.

I think I understand ERMS and \nTAGG but the issues facing \n       scheduling in Unify are grey.\n\n2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the \"assume it is messed up\" \npolicy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need \nfurther      scrutiny.\n\n3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical \nimbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?\n\n4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training \ncourses, review progress and make cuts.\n\n5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at \neverything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add \n   some value and direction to the group.\n\n\nIn fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD \nto work part time to get it done.\n\nPhillip\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/489."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <32810407.1075855686326.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 14 Jan 2018 03:28:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: scott.tholan@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Response to San Diego Request for Gas Price Caps\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Scott Tholan\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 12/13/2000 \n11:28 AM ---------------------------\nFrom: Sarah Novosel@ENRON on 12/13/2000 10:17 AM CST\nTo: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan J \nMara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard \nShapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard B \nSanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Miller/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Christi L \nNicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, pkaufma@enron.com, \npallen@enron.com\ncc:  \nSubject: Enron Response to San Diego Request for Gas Price Caps\n\nPlease review the attached draft Enron comments in response to the San Diego \nrequest for natural gas price caps.

Their version includes the salary of a \nsuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third \nparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\" \nfees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be \npaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally \nthe builders profit of 1.4 million.\n\nKeith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out \nof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if \nthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  \nWe were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition \nto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been \nin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and \nthe superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management \nfee is included.\n\nGeorge gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will \nreview and let you know what I think.\n\nThe GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to \nthe 3 out 4 approval process.\n\nLet me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only \ntrue costs + 1.4 million.\n\nPhillip\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/495."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <12435301.1075855726958.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 3 Apr 2018 01:09:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: cbpres@austin.rr.com\nSubject: Re: DRAW2.xls\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nGeorge,\n\nPlease send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/496."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <23109123.1075855726979.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 17 Apr 2018 00:46:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jeanie.slone@enron.com\nSubject: \nCc: john.lavorato@enron.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nBcc: john.lavorato@enron.com\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Jeanie Slone\nX-cc: John J Lavorato\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nJeanie,\n\nLavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into \npart time.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\nBut that still wasn't enough juice.\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\n$250/MWh price cap.\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\nPowerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\nWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\nwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\nDorinson said.\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\nthe high-priced power.\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail\ncustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity\nrates or if companies will absorb the costs.\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay\nPwr Plant\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent\nSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy\nCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,\nWednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.\nThe ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state\nsince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the\nreasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nAbout 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,\n7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the\nISO.\nThe ISO manages grid reliability.\nAs previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert\nat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would\ndip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid\ncollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling\nblackouts.\nThe ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),\nReliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).\nDuke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives\nin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.\n\n\n   -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line\nPower Plants\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\n\n   By Jessica Berthold\n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said\nWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by\nsome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate\nreasons.\nThe California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power\ngrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public\nUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power\nplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,\nISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nThe state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for\nunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency\nfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and\ncustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be\ncalled on to do so.\nAs reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)\nsaid they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday\nevening.\nRepresentatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES\nand Dynegy Tuesday evening.\nAES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection\nof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday\nmorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron\nThomas said.\nThomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives\nreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.\n\n   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits\n\nThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have\nused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\nThomas said.\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\nand Redondo Beach plants.\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\n\"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\"\nThomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\ndistrict's\" authority.\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\n\n   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\n\nDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday\nevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line\nWednesday.\n\"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you\nneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegy\nspokesman Lynn Lednicky.\nLednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and\nthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could\npose a safety hazard if not repaired.\n\"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We\neven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"\nLednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of\nwhy its units were off line.\n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n\n\nG_nther A.

I have shifted \nto a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could \nnot work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more \ntowards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One \nwing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 \nkid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + \nguestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This \nplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the \ncourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor \nliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. \n The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass \nskylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have \nsingle slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  \n\nI don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would \nlike to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I \nwould like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \nrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \ncost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \nrepairs.\n\n2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \nonsite.\n\n3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\n\n4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \nthis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\n\nMy job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property \ndefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.\n\n\nSales Price  705,000\n\n1st Lien   473,500\n\n2nd Lien  225,000\n\nTransfer fee    7,500\n\nCash required   14,500\n\n\nNOI   100,000\n\n1st Lien    47,292\n\n2nd Lien   23,694\n\nCash flow  29,014\n\nCash on cash  200%\n\n\nThese numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then \ncash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the \nadditional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years \nfor a higher price.\n\nDo you want to reconsider?  Let me know.\n\nPhillip\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/537."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <4137934.1075855727873.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 5 Jan 2018 23:14:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com\nSubject: Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG -- CPUC Audit Report on\n Edison\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/31/2001=\n=20\n07:12 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nSusan J Mara@ENRON\n01/30/2001 10:10 AM\nTo: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Angela Schwarz/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly=20\nAden/HOU/EES@EES, Bill Votaw/HOU/EES@EES, Brenda Barreda/HOU/EES@EES, Carol=\n=20\nMoffett/HOU/EES@EES, Cathy Corbin/HOU/EES@EES, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT,=\n=20\nChristina Liscano/HOU/EES@EES, Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Craig H=20\nSutter/HOU/EES@EES, Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES, Debora Whitehead/HOU/EES@EES,=20\nDennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, Don Black/HOU/EES@EES, Dorothy=20\nYoungblood/HOU/ECT@ECT, Douglas Huth/HOU/EES@EES, Edward=20\nSacks/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Eric Melvin/HOU/EES@EES, Erika Dupre/HOU/EES@EES,=\n=20\nEvan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Fran Deltoro/HOU/EES@EES, Frank W=20\nVickers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gayle W Muench/HOU/EES@EES, Ginger=20\nDernehl/NA/Enron@ENRON, Gordon Savage/HOU/EES@EES, Harold G=20\nBuchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@ENRON, Iris Waser/HOU/EES@EE=\nS,=20\nJames D Steffes/NA/Enron@ENRON, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, James=20\nWright/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Jeff Messina/HOU/EES@EE=\nS,=20\nJeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Jess Hewitt/HOU/EES@EES, Joe=20\nHartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kathy=20\nBass/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Ken Gustafson/HOU/EES@EES, Kevi=\nn=20\nHughes/HOU/EES@EES, Leasa Lopez/HOU/EES@EES, Leticia Botello/HOU/EES@EES,=\n=20\nMark S Muller/HOU/EES@EES, Marsha Suggs/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EE=\nS,=20\nMeredith M Eggleston/HOU/EES@EES, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael=20\nMann/HOU/EES@EES, Michelle D Cisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike M Smith/HOU/EES@EES=\n,=20\nmpalmer@enron.com, Neil Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Neil Hong/HOU/EES@EES, Paul=20\nKaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Paula Warren/HOU/EES@EES, Richard L=20\nZdunkewicz/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Leibert/HOU/EES@EES, Richard=20\nShapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rita Hennessy/NA/Enron@ENRON, Robert=20\nBadeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES, Rosalinda Tijerina/HOU/EES@EES,=\n=20\nSandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott=20\nGahn/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, Sharon Dick/HOU/EES@EES,=20\nskean@enron.com, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Leslie/HOU/EES@EES, Tas=\nha=20\nLair/HOU/EES@EES, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Terri Greenlee/NA/Enron@ENRON, Ti=\nm=20\nBelden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tony Spruiell/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES,=20\nVladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wanda Curry/HOU/EES@EES, William S=20\nBradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jubran Whalan/HOU/EES@EES, triley@enron.com, Richard =\nB=20\nSanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,=\n=20\ndwatkiss@bracepatt.com, rcarroll@bracepatt.com, Donna=20\nFulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, gfergus@brobeck.com, Kathryn=20\nCorbally/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bruno Gaillard/EU/Enron@Enron, Linda=20\nRobertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ren, Lazure/Western=\n=20\nRegion/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Michael Tribolet/Corp/Enron@Enron,=20\nPhillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B=20\nSanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, jklauber@llgm.com, Tamara Johnson/HOU/EES@EES, Robert =\nC=20\nWilliams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: =20\nSubject: Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG -- CPUC Audit Report on=20\nEdison\n\n\n----- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/NA/Enron on 01/30/2001 10:02 AM -----\n\n=09\"Daniel Douglass\" <Douglass@ArterHadden.com>\n=0901/30/2001 08:31 AM\n=09=09=20\n=09=09 To: <Barbara_Klemstine@apsc.com>, <berry@apx.com>, <dcazalet@apx.com=\n>,=20\n<billr@calpine.com>, <jackp@calpine.com>, <glwaas@calpx.com>,=20\n<Ken_Czarnecki@calpx.com>, <gavaughn@duke-energy.com>,=20\n<rjhickok@duke-energy.com>, <gtbl@dynegy.com>, <jmpa@dynegy.com>,=20\n<jdasovic@enron.com>, <susan_j_mara@enron.com>, <Tamara_Johnson@enron.com>,=\n=20\n<curt.Hatton@gen.pge.com>, <foothill@lmi.net>, <camiessn@newwestenergy.com>=\n,=20\n<jcgardin@newwestenergy.com>, <jsmollon@newwestenergy.com>,=20\n<rsnichol@newwestenergy.com>, <Curtis_L_Kebler@reliantenergy.com>,=20\n<rllamkin@seiworldwide.com>\n=09=09 cc:=20\n=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison\n\nThe following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=\nit=20\nreport on Southern California Edison:\n=20\nI. Cash Needs\nHighlights:\nSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\nplete=20\ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\ns=20\nand other measures.=20\nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\n.8=20\nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\nII. Credit Relationships\nHighlights:\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\nSCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\nlt.=20\nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\nnd=20\npayable.\nSCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\n=20\nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\nits=20\nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\n=20\nissues within the last three weeks.\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\nHighlights\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\nvarious price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\n such=20\nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\nHighlights\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\n=20\nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\nTotal                                             $ 460\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\n=20\nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\nom=20\ncontract employees.\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\n=20\nmost part being deferred to a future date.\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\nsavings of approximately $92 million.\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\nActivity)\nHighlights:\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\n=20\nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\ne=20\nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\n=20\nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\nD.01-01-018.\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20\ntracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20\nexpressed in the TRA, are overstated.\nTURN Proposal\nAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=\nRN=20\nto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=\ns.=20\nOur comments are summarized as follows:\nThe Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=\nt=20\nwould not directly generate nor use cash.\nThe Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=\nift=20\ncosts between two regulatory assets.\nTURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=\n the=20\nrevenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =\nin=20\nthe TRA is overstated.\nVI. Flow of Funds Analysis\nHighlights:\nIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=\n=20\npositive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\nDuring the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=\n=20\nits parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\nEdison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=\n=20\nshareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=\non=20\nstock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=\nve=20\nand general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\n[there is no Section VII]\n=20\nVIII. Earnings of California Affiliates\nSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=\n=20\nmillion annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20\nIn 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=\n=20\nThis increase correlates to the increase in market prices\nfor natural gas for the same period.\nA copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20\nwww.cpuc.ca.gov.\n=20\nDan\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/538."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <21486271.1075855728009.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 19 Jan 2018 03:45:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLucy,\n\nWhat is the latest?

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but \ncould be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule \nmust be discussed and agreed upon.\n\nFeel free to call me at home (713)463-8626\n\n\nPhillip\n \n \n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/544."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <11509085.1075855728144.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Feb 2018 07:15:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: cbpres@austin.rr.com\nSubject: RE: Loan for San Marcos\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nGeorge,\n\nWe should hear from the bank in Houston on Monday.\n\nThe best numbers and times to reach me:\n\nwork 713-853-7041\nfax 713-464-2391\ncell 713-410-4679\nhome 713-463-8626\npallen70@hotmail.com (home)\npallen@enron.com (work)\n\nI am usually at work M-F 7am-5:30pm.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially \ncomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with \nthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of \nwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who \nswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the \nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \n(and maybe earlier).\n\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \nForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get \nsome assurances of payment. \n\nSCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due \non 2/2/01.\n\nFor gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's \npurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements \n(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be \nresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this \noccurred today.\n\nStatus of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will \nhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  \nPlan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .

Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\n\"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, \na trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \n\nBut the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\n\"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting,\" McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \nfingers at Wall Street. \n\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for \nthe rise in gas prices. \n\n\"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \n\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \n\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \nfor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \n\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \nprices before they soared. \n\n\"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \n\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \n\n\"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \nchange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \n\n\nHot topic \n\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \nmany circles, little else is discussed. \n\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \nprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \ncustomers. \n\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \nfor winter. \n\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \nmarkets. \n\n\"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \ncommodity in the world. \n\n\nSetting the price \n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \nwidespread influence over gas prices. \n\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \n\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \nof natural gas. \n\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \ntheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \nin a short time. \n\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \nweekly storage numbers. \n\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \nneed in the winter. \n\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \nhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \nsufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \nassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n\nBut some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n\n\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n\nThen suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \nWednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n\n\nJust passing through \n\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \npass their fuel costs on to customers. \n\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \nenergy. \n\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \n\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \ncosts. \n\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \n\n\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider \nsome changes.\" \n\n\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \nseverly@kcstar.com. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star  ", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/557."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <10513667.1075855728452.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sat, 24 Feb 2018 00:38:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Please respond\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nmessage board", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/558."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <5576094.1075855728473.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 6 Mar 2018 00:34:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Please respond\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nneed help.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but \ncould be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule \nmust be discussed and agreed upon.\n\nFeel free to call me at home (713)463-8626\n\n\nPhillip\n \n ", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/574."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <10473497.1075855728819.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sat, 7 Apr 2018 03:06:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nCc: gallen@thermon.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nBcc: gallen@thermon.com\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nX-cc: gallen@thermon.com\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLucy,\n\nHere is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.

In attendance were Ken Lay, \nthe Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \nproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \nbased on the governor's comments:\n\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \nthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \nwas a frequently recurring theme.\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \nbasis to consumers.\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \nCalifornia.\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \nwidely deploy distributed generation.\nExpand in-state gas production.\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \naddtional gas supplies.\nEmpower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \nmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \nany one time.\nCondition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\nEither eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \nmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be \nable to help out here).\nWants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \nsome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \nsome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \nthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \napproach with generators.\nSecuritize uncollected power purchase costs.\nTo dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's \nthoughts and get them to Kari)\nHe wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \nnot just the 5 one year strips.\nHe wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\nHe would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \ndeal.\nHe wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \nforward contracting issues.\nThanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/583."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <7275000.1075855729016.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 18 Mar 2018 05:19:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: john.lavorato@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: John J Lavorato\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nTrading Profits\n\nP.

If \nyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as recommendations, here is a short list:\n\n 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales \nabove monthly index without enough consideration of future \n      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \ninjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\n                    This creates a shortage in later months.\n\n 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \ndemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  \n                      Specific questions should include:  \n\n  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order \nto fill storage?\n\n  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \nmuch gas from Socal's system.  \n       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their \nown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than \ntheir injection capablity, but injected far less.\n\n 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short \nterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major \n                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating \nrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market \nand the \n     consumer has benefitted.  \n\n\nCall me if you need any more input.\n\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/589."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <25851542.1075855686544.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 30 Mar 2018 08:22:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLucy,\n\n Here is a rentroll for this week.

Note that the\nconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\nstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio\nof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.\n\nAlso, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs\nare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\nactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\nwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\n\nIt appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly\nsure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.\n\nI hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are\n$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3\nbedroom.

Any possibility for a=\n deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=\nans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=\nus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=\nans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=\nnce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=\n dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=\nislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=\ne details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=\ne.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=\ng-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=\nhat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =\nbreach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=\ne bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=\nll be very difficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=\ne would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=\n Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =\n$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =\nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=\nl disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =\ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=\n will support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =\n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=\nll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=\nk of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=\nr community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=\nended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=\nntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =\npaid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=\nkely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20\n=20\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=\nans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =\nthe General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =\nof the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=\nicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=\n to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=\nrtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=\nications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n=20\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 B\nLenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B\n=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B\n=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M\nTax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\nProjected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77%\n=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%\nCurrent Projected=20\nBlended IR:=09=095.38%\nMaturity Date:=09=09August 29, 2001\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\n\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=\nhe California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=\n authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=\nhorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=\ntional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =\ngoing forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=\nations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =\nhas  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =\nthat must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=\nurther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =\nis clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=\ning power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=\nornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=\ndered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=\nier in the crisis.\n=20\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=\nhe first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =\ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=\ngust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=\no sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=\nigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=\ns and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=\nes that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=\nruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20\n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=\nsuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=\ntating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=\nen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=\nate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=\nassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=\n bankruptcy.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat\n", "file": "allen-p/_sent_mail/94."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <30732006.1075855687344.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sat, 14 Apr 2018 05:52:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: bob.m.hall@enron.com\nSubject: \nCc: robert.superty@enron.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nBcc: robert.superty@enron.com\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: bob.m.hall@enron.com\nX-cc: Robert Superty\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\'sent mail\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nBob,\n\n Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her \nefforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.

Temperatures\ncould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.\n     \"Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of\nthe morning,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"By options expiration\nthe market had pretty much dried up.\"\n     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main\nreason for the decline in spot market prices.\n     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the\nNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million\nBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since\nMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of\n$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts\nindicated reduced utility load requirements.\n     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they\nnormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather\nforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.\n     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13\nhigher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the\n$67.00-$75.00 range.

Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent\nelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired\ngeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.\n     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average\nof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British\nthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average\nof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.\n     \"The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got\npeople coming to their senses,\" one trader said. \"These are much\nmore realistic prices.\"\n     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the\noutlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for\ndelivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00\nyesterday.\n     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged\nwith warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission\ncapacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in\nsouthern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.\n     \"What's happening is the people who don't have firm\ntransmission are getting into the market early and buying at those\nhigh prices since they have no choice,\" one MAPP trader said.\n     \"Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a\nfirm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices\nfell off,\" he said, \"and bought from them at those lower prices,\ncausing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.\"\n\n-Ken Fahnestock\n\n\nSoutheast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast\n\n     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast\nU.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was\nforecast for the region this week, traders said.\n     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since\nmany large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures\nclimb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.\n     \"There was nothing going on in Florida today,\" said one\nsouthern energy trader. \"Everything was going to markets in the\nnorth.\"\n     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into\nmarkets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority\ngrid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.\n     \"Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as\nforecasts came out,\" said on Entergy power trader. \"Prices,\ndeclined to $60 and less.\"\n     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95\nto $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades\nwere noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent\nestimates.\n     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather\nforecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week\ncaused prices to decline in the region.\n     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was\nthe main culprit behind lower prices.\n     \"The cold weather's backing off,\" said one SPP utility\ntrader. \"It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and\ntoday it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was\nbitter cold and today it was just plain cold.\"\n     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though\nthe Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern\nSPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.\n\n-Brian Whary\n\n\n\nU.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand\n\n     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in\nthe U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to\nincrease household consumption for space heating, traders said.\n     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the\nElectricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01\npounds a megawatt-hour.\n     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees\nto 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services\nCorp. in the U.S.\n     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15\npounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.\n     December continued to fall amid a combination of position\nclosing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will\nnot rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.\n     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.\n     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with\nexpectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue\nto stifle demand, traders said.\n     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.\n     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.\n     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer\n2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.\nWinter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour.\n     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely\nforce many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-\nup to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will\nprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more\neasily be assessed.\n\n-Nick Livingstone\n\n\nNordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast\n\n     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices\non the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today\nas colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.\n     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-\nhour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076\nmegawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446\nmegawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.\n     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after\nforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for\nnext week. These producers typically generate power to prevent\nreservoirs from overflowing.\n     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise\nwith falling temperatures because of increased requirements for\nspace heating.\n     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active\ntrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders\nsaid.\n     \"The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,\" a\nStockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have been\nselling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should\nnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"\n     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall\nbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited\nchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather\nServices Corp. in the U.S.\n     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was\nexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict\ntemperatures to begin falling.\n     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22\npercent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell\n4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.\n     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise\nby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.\n     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-\nterm contracts.\n     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,\n1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a\nmegawatt-hour.\n     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although\nexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers\nto meet the increased demand, other traders said.\n     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,\nwill delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.\n     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used\ntoday's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.\n\n-Nick Livingstone\n-0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT\n=0F$\n\n\n - daily.pdf", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/10."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <7452188.1075855667684.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:16:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: keith.holst@enron.com\nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Keith Holst\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/09/2000 \n02:16 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nRichard Burchfield\n10/06/2000 06:59 AM\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\n\nPhillip,\n Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the \nrequirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport \ntrade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; \nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \nproject.\n\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \ngood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\n\nRichard  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 \n08:34 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nAllan Severude\n10/05/2000 06:03 PM\nTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott \nMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\n\n\nFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated \npositions, I think we still have the following issues:\nWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had \nthree meetings which brought out very different issues from different \ntraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader \nrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.\nWe're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to \nbe outside the scope of position consolidation.\n\nThings left to do:\nI think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to \nmake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this \nproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\nGo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \nproject and which fall out of scope.\nFor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\nDefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \ndrill downs.\nUse the above to formulate a project plan.\n\nThings requested thus far (no particular order):\nInclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal \nticker.\nCustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\nNew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \ntransport, swaps, options, ...\nAddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\nAbility to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \nshown directly above monthly positions.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; \nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \nproject.\n\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \ngood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\n\nRichard  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 \n08:34 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nAllan Severude\n10/05/2000 06:03 PM\nTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott \nMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\n\n\nFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated \npositions, I think we still have the following issues:\nWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had \nthree meetings which brought out very different issues from different \ntraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader \nrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.\nWe're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to \nbe outside the scope of position consolidation.\n\nThings left to do:\nI think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to \nmake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this \nproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\nGo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \nproject and which fall out of scope.\nFor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\nDefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \ndrill downs.\nUse the above to formulate a project plan.\n\nThings requested thus far (no particular order):\nInclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal \nticker.\nCustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\nNew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \ntransport, swaps, options, ...\nAddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\nAbility to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \nshown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid \nwould be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.\nAbility to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the \nappropriate positions to show for each:\nGas Daily for monthly index,\nPhysical gas for Nymex,\nPhysical gas for Inside Ferc,\nPhysical gas for Mid market.\nAbility for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of \nusing official valuations.\nPosition and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.\nAbility to include the Gas Price book into TDS:\nInclusion of spread options in our systems.

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Now or for the land closing? Investment \nschedule?\n\n Investment Return\n\n Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?\n\n Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits \nare distributed?\n\n Debt\n\n Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral \nis associated with each \n loan?\n\n Improvement\n\n Construction\n\n Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.\n\n Terms of each loan?\n\n Uses of Funds\n\n How will disbursements be made?  By whom?\n\n What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing \nfor investors?\n\n Reports to track expenses vs plan?\n\n Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\n\n What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get \npaid a markup on subcontractors as a \n general contractor and paid gain out of profits?\n\n Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses \nbefore the ultimate payout of profits?\n\n Design and Construction\n \n When will design be complete?\n\n What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?\n\n What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction \nplanning and permitting?\n\n Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, \nvendors, and other professionals? \n Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?\n\n Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to \nuse? Names?\n\nThese questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor \nin a project like this it is new to me.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.

Exodus is now wrapping up \nconstruction\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \na mile from its\n                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \nfiber optic backbones, the\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \neventually\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \n\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \ncenters near Seattle.\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \nGlobix and\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \nthe networking\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \n\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \neverything from your\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \nyour favorite Web sites.\n\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \nserver farms, are\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \nValley that some\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \nPuget Sound\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \nhigh-security\n                  facilities. \n\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \nare requesting 445\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \nsaid Karl\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \nEnergy. \"That is\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \n\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \nthe rise of the Internet\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \nheads. \n\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \nUtilities and\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \ndata centers. The\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing \nresidential and business\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \nnecessary to support\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \nmillion each,\n                  Karzmar said. \n\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \nbring up the data center\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \n\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \nbusinesses and schools in the\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \n\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \nappetite for power --\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \nfacilities run 24 hours a\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \nconstant revenue\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \nthey could\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \nexpenditures. \n\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \nmean for power rates\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \n\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \nCity Light. \n\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \nlights at the football\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \nWe have data\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \nand 50 megawatts.\" \n\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \ncomplex in Tukwila is\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \nthe 1.35 million\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \nBoeing Space &\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \n92 percent of the\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \ncompanies. \n\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \nCommunications,\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \nNetworks all\n                  lease space in the office park. \n\n                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \nSabey has become an\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \nmanagement or\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \nclaims his firm is\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \nthe country. \n\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \nbandwidth-heavy tasks\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \nco-location space in\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \n\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \nspace is growing at a\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \ncausing similar\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \nCalifornia. \n\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \nspace, plans to nearly\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \nWhile companies\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \nhigh-tech companies\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \nas Exodus that\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \nmanagement. \n\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \nconstruction and we plan to\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \ndemand right now\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \nexecutive at Exodus in\n                  Seattle. \n\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \nin the local utility\n                  industry perplexed. \n\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \nto serve the growth,\"\n                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is \nalmost stunned by this, in\n                  a way.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/146."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <15247593.1075855668727.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 2 Jan 2018 03:46:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: Re:\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nIna,\n\n Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance \nreviews from H.R.\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000 \n10:44 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nJohn J Lavorato@ENRON\n09/06/2000 05:39 AM\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re:  \n\nThe commercial support people that you and Hunter want to make commercial \nmanagers.  \n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/147."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <11108465.1075855668749.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sat, 7 Apr 2018 23:22:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: john.lavorato@enron.com\nSubject: Re:\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: John J Lavorato\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nresumes of whom?", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/148."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <3119834.1075855668771.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 17 Apr 2018 06:51:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence\n Program\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 \n01:50 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"Christi Smith\" <christi.smith@lrinet.com> on 09/05/2000 11:40:59 AM\nPlease respond to <christi.smith@lrinet.com>\nTo: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com>\ncc: \"Debbie Nowak (E-mail)\" <dnowak@enron.com> \nSubject: RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence \nProgram\n\n\nWe have not received your completed Team Selection information.

See if you can add \nthese modifications:\n\n 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It \nshould read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.\n\n 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  \n=e6-g6.\n\n 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width \nis too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the \n       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.\n\n 4.

The \nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their \ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \nthe generation side.\n\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \nthey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\n\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \nothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas \ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \nespecially compared to all gas consumption.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \nI'll take care of it..\n\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \n$235,019.   \n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \nGDP-Kingsgate.\n\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \ncase there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the \nvolumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. \n \nDeal #  251327                  159540                   265229         \n106300   201756\nP&L  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199)          \n($2,769)   ($273)\nRec:   Ques/Clay Basin/0184   NWPL/Opal 543  NWPL/Opal   Sumas      NWPL/S of \nGr Rvr\nDel:   NWPL/S of Green River/Clay   Ques/Clay Basin/0852   Ques/Clay \nBasin/0852   Ques/Clay Basin    Ques/Clay Basin\n1        329       8,738\n2     1,500\n3         2,974    11,362\n4         6,741    12,349       1,439\n5       19,052          3,183\n9            333\n13  30,863       2,680\n14  30,451    \n15  35,226    \n16         6,979              235 \n17  17,464     \n18    9,294     \n20  10,796          771\n21  17,930     \n22  10,667     \n23       14,415          9,076\n25  23,934       8,695\n26     3,284     \n27         1,976\n28     1,751     \n29     1,591     \n30  20,242     \n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/253."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <1670364.1075855671043.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:19:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: maryrichards7@hotmail.com\nSubject: Re: balance on truck/loan\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: \"mary richards\" <maryrichards7@hotmail.com> @ ENRON\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nMary,\n\nIf we add both balances together the total is $1,140.

We are pursuing a confidentiality \nagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable \nus to develop proposals.

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/265."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <16945.1075855671306.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 7 Feb 2018 06:40:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: hargr@webtv.net\nSubject: Re: #30\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: hargr@webtv.net (Neal Hargrove) @ ENRON\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nKay & Neal,\n\nThanks for remembering my birthday.

The book\ncovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.\n\nI find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -\ninteresting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years\nlearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,\nstructures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have\nlasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good\nbackground information for sustainable builder folks.\n\nThank you, Mr. Moore.

Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.\nspot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply\noutstripped demand.\n     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak\npower dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-\nhour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.\n     \"Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing\nprices to decline,\" said one Southwest trader.\n     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington\nMassachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach\n75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.\n     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank\n$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as\ntraders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.\n     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt\nPalo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased\nproduction to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a\nscheduled refueling outage that began March 31.\n     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power\nslumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a\nBloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.\n     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,\ntemperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees\nFahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling\ndemand 84 percent below normal.\n     \"We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is\ncausing temperatures to drop,\" said one Northwest trader.\n     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak\npower fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at\n$175.00-$228.00.\n     According the California Independent System Operator today's\nforecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743\nmegawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.\n\n-Robert Scalabrino\n\n\nNortheast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand\n\n     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in\navailable generation coupled with less weather-related demand,\ncaused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much\nas 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.\n     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,\ntemperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree\nFahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and\ncooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.\n     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak\npower scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg\nvolume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from\nFriday.\n     \"There's just no weather out there,\" said one PJM-based\ntrader. \"There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for\nheating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week\nlong.\"\n     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000\nmegawatts through Friday.\n     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for\nthe dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to\nservice today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to\nhit the grid tomorrow.\n     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York\nPower Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2\nnuclear power facilities.\n     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1\nat 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of\na refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at\nfull power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned\nand operated by Niagara Mohawk.\n     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to\n$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to\n$51.25 and $40.00 indices.\n     ~\n-Karyn Rispoli\n\n\nWeather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up\n\n     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak\npower prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high\nweather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,\ntraders said.\n     \"It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee\nValley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy\nto there,\" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.\n\"Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of\nthat.\"\n     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday\ninto the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose\n$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25\nwhen the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.\n     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00\nand power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the\nSoutheast was expected to remain high into next week.\n     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at\n$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,\nforecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.\n     \"Things should continue along these lines for the rest of\nthe week, because there's enough power to get down there but not\nso much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,\" an\nECAR trader said.\n     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from\nthe Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,\nthough traders said transmission problems limited volume.\n     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the\nChicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,\nand $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with\ntrades from $32.00-$40.00.\n     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also\nclimbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as\nabove-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems\nisolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.\n     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern\nMAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern\nhalf of the region at $45.00-$52.00.\n     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.\npredicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in\nMinneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.\n     \"There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems\ngetting power out of Ameren's grid too,\" one MAPP trader said.\n\"It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and\ndown in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).\"\n\n-Ken Fahnestock\n\n\nSoutheast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up\n\n     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot\nelectricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to\nmajor Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.\n     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather\nServices Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta\nvicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5\ndegrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is\nexpected to begin Wednesday.\n     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,\ntemperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,\npropelling air conditioning demand, traders said.\n      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council\nregional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from\nequivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.\nTrades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.\n     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an\naverage of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid\ntrades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.\n     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm\nenergy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders\ncomplained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.\n     \"There's just no overnight load to do anything with the\nsupply we have,\" said one Texas-based utility power trader.\n\"Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree\n(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is\n85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.\"\n     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for\ntomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done\nat a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders\nsaid forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South\nstarting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at\n$35-$36.\n     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy\nat $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because\npower from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.\n     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg\nindex of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.\n     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the\nbalance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later\ntrades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy\npower was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders\nsaid.\n     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was\nbid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for\nthe balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades\nwere noted.\n\n-Brian Whary\n\n\nU.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids\n\n     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.\nfell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling\ninterest, traders said.\n     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before\nclosing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than\nFriday.\n     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of\nthe month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one\ntrading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was\nshort. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition\nfrom another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting\nprice levels, traders said.\n     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was\nexpected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production\ncosts because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.\n     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after\nlast trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.\n     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas\nfutures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15\npence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since\nthe start of last week.\n     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental\nreasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the\nmarket, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.\nMost trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,\nthey said.\n\n-Amal Halawi\n\n\nNordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest\n\n     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term\nelectricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,\nNorway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed\nto buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid\nlimited hydro-supply, traders said.\n     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all\ntime high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00\nmegawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.\nWinter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-\n214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.\n     \"The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now\nyou have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-\nbased trader said. \"I'm surprised that even at the peak of the\nsnow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are\nsteadily climbing.''\n     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent\nabove normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.\nStill, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a \"more\nrealistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet\noutlooks.''\n     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations\nof 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,\ndown 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was\na \"high'' spot price for this time of the year.\n     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour\nwith 140 megawatts exchanged.\n     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours\ngeneration, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.\n\n-Alejandro Barbajosa\n-0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT\n=0F$\n\n\n - daily.pdf", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/359."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <5161987.1075855666285.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 3 Jan 2018 05:27:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: jsmith@austintx.com\nTo: phillip.k.allen@enron.com\nSubject: RE: stage coach\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Jeff Smith\" <jsmith@austintx.com>\nX-To: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nPhillip,\n\nI am completing my marketing package for the Stage.

Any possibility for a \ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \ndifficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \ndisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the \ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should \nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \n \nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n \nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\nLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\n   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\n   Bear Stearns  $625 M\nTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\nProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\n   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\nCurrent Projected \nBlended IR:  5.38%\nMaturity Date:  August 29, 2001\nFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\n\nBill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\nThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \nCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \nidea  earlier in the crisis.\n \nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \nstating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \nthen the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \nstate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \npassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \nbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \nthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/369."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <19321959.1075855666306.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 11 Feb 2018 04:53:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: critical.notice@enron.com\nTo: ywang@enron.com, patti.sullivan@enron.com, phillip.k.allen@enron.com, \n\tjane.m.tholt@enron.com, mike.grigsby@enron.com\nSubject: New Notice from Transwestern Pipeline Co.\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: critical.notice@Enron.com\nX-To: ywang@Enron.com, Patti.Sullivan@Enron.com, Phillip.K.Allen@Enron.com, jane.m.tholt@Enron.com, Mike.Grigsby@Enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nTranswestern Pipeline Co. posted new notice(s) since our last check at \n12/12/2000 12:18:01 PM, the newest notice looks like:\n\n Capacity Constraint, Dec 12 2000 12:25PM, Dec 13 2000  9:00AM, Dec 14 2000  \n8:59AM, 2231, Allocation - SOCAL NEEDLES\n\nPlease click the following to go to the web site for detail.\n\nhttp://ios.ets.enron.com/infoPostings/shared/et_noncritical_notice.asp?company\n=60", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/37."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <25550120.1075855693958.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 31 Jan 2018 05:18:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com, \n\tjane.tholt@enron.com, jay.reitmeyer@enron.com, \n\ttori.kuykendall@enron.com, matthew.lenhart@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power Conf.

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook \nclient will be configured on your computer.\nAfter migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail \nvia Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is \nconfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is \nmigrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your \nweb browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and \nTo-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook \nclient is configured on your desktop.\n\n2. Remote access to your mailbox.\nAfter your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) \nfor remote access to your mailbox.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while \nconnecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA \navailable from your home or when traveling abroad.\n\nHOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)\n\nLaunch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  \nhttp://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe\n\nSubstitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You \nwill be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your user \nid\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You \nwill now be able to view your mailbox.\n\n \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between \nthe Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things \nin OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the \nfunctions NOT available via OWA:\n\nFeatures NOT available using OWA:\n\n-  Tasks\n-  Journal\n-  Spell Checker\n-  Offline Use\n-  Printing Templates\n-  Reminders\n-  Timed Delivery\n-  Expiration\n-  Outlook Rules\n-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall\n-  Sharing Contacts with others\n-  Task Delegation\n-  Direct Resource Booking\n-  Personal Distribution Lists\n\nQUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?\n\nIf you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the \nOutlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:\n\n Outlook.2000@enron.com\n\nOtherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:\n\n 713-853-1411\n\nThank you,\n\nOutlook 2000 Migration Team\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/376."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <227662.1075855694115.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 2 Jan 2018 07:14:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: 2- SURVEY/INFORMATION EMAIL\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that \nthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large \npart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which \nthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman \nbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \nanswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \nsome enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \ndemand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \nexport California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty \nstrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \nout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \nif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \nagenda.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \ncompared with the previous year.\n\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\n\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \nquestions or need any further information.\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/417."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <2829833.1075855695221.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 28 Mar 2018 07:39:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLucy,\n\nHere is the rentroll from last friday.  \n\nThe closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday \nApril 20th.

Center Garage\n\nThe Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.\n\nEmployees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new \nbuilding and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being \noffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.\n\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \nemployee cost of $94.00.\n\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \nas spaces become available. \n\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \n\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \ngarage.\n\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \n\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/429."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <32905404.1075855666437.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 27 Mar 2018 06:23:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLucy,\n\nHere is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.

As you can see even \nreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only \ngenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about \nsuch a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down \nto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?\n\nI realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you \nlocal connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of \nthe office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.\n\nPhillip\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/432."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <353722.1075855695551.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 8 Jan 2018 02:19:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: scfatkfa@caprock.net\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: scfatkfa@caprock.net\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nCary,\n\nHere is the picture of the house I have in mind.

Below is a \nlist of questions on the specs:\n\n1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less \nand cost about the same?\n\n2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory \njoist?\n\n3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?\n\n4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What \ntype of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or \nCellulose?\n\n5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?\n\n6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know \nthe difference between an apron and a stool.\n\n7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent \ncracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?\n\n8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial \none out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.\n\n9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under \nthe stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.\n\n10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount \nstainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.\n\n11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.\n\n12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?\n\n13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?\n\n14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron \nrailings?\n\n15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except \nfor change orders?\n\nI want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but \nthis is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to \ncall Cary Kipp to\nsee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.\n\nPhillip\nI\n\n ", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/438."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <31991549.1075855695682.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 22 Jan 2018 04:43:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: llewter@austin.rr.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: llewter@austin.rr.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLarry,\n\nJacques has sent a document to Claudia for your review.

You mentioned 2% \noverhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.\n\nWhy is profit only 4%? \n\nWhy are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.\n\nWhat is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to \nboost loan amount but not a real cost?\n\nTotal Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who \nreceives the 2 points?

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\nBut that still wasn't enough juice.\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\n$250/MWh price cap.\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\nPowerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\nWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\nwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\nDorinson said.\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\nthe high-priced power.\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail\ncustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity\nrates or if companies will absorb the costs.\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay\nPwr Plant\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent\nSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy\nCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,\nWednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.\nThe ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state\nsince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the\nreasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nAbout 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,\n7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the\nISO.\nThe ISO manages grid reliability.\nAs previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert\nat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would\ndip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid\ncollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling\nblackouts.\nThe ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),\nReliant Energy Inc.

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said\nWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by\nsome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate\nreasons.\nThe California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power\ngrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public\nUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power\nplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,\nISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nThe state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for\nunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency\nfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and\ncustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be\ncalled on to do so.\nAs reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)\nsaid they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday\nevening.\nRepresentatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES\nand Dynegy Tuesday evening.\nAES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection\nof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday\nmorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron\nThomas said.\nThomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives\nreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.\n\n   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits\n\nThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have\nused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\nThomas said.\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\nand Redondo Beach plants.\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\n\"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\"\nThomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\ndistrict's\" authority.\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\n\n   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\n\nDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday\nevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line\nWednesday.\n\"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you\nneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegy\nspokesman Lynn Lednicky.\nLednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and\nthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could\npose a safety hazard if not repaired.\n\"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We\neven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"\nLednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of\nwhy its units were off line.\n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n\n\nG_nther A.

The agency said it had\nbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that the\nsales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.\n\nCal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than\nyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.\nYesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because\nof concerns about its water reserves.

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \ncurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\n\nActing in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \nproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \nand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \nour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \nrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \n\nTwo methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \npercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \nyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \nor $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \nsecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \nyear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \nvaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \nforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \nthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \nprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \nmonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the \nattached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings \nthe total net buyout to $78,946.? \n\nWe still believe that this project needs the professional services that we \noffer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout \noffer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are \nprepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? \nIf this is your \n\n\n\nchoice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, \nClaudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then \ndraft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the \nBishops Corner, Ltd.

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is \nstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot \nand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a \ntopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to \ncoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the \nsmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going \nto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to \ncomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which \n$14,000 are due now for work completed.  \n\nWe are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by \nthe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can \ncontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's \nnumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and \nask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call \nand he was fine with that.  \n\nNow we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp \nFlores can be used.\n\nKeith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very \noptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.\n\nCall me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about \nmoving this project forward.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/471."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <7032342.1075855696407.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 8 Mar 2018 03:49:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jacquestc@aol.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Jacquestc@aol.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nHere is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \n500+\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \nthis,\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\n\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\n\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\n\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\n\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\nturn over.\n\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\n\n4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \ndebt\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\n\n5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\n\n6.

I would like \nto proceed and develop the property. \n\n My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would \nalso like to compare construction and development services between what you \ncan do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  \nMaking a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to \nbe in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural \nwork to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is \nQuattro Consultants out of Buda.

It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can\nproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for\nlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.

Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) \nwill\nbe in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the\nacceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma\nperformance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit\nofficer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer\nsigning off on the deal.\n\n3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers\ndeferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as\ndeferred profit has been acceptable.\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew Ozuna\nReal Estate Loan Officer\n210-271-8386\n##\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/498."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <8962949.1075855697008.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 23 Feb 2018 03:17:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: barry.tycholiz@enron.com\nSubject: New Generation Report for January 2001\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Barry Tycholiz\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 02/23/2001 \n11:17 AM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Jeffrey Oh                           02/02/2001 08:51 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie A Gomez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tim \nBelden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mike \nSwerzbin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jim Gilbert/PDX/ECT@ECT, David Parquet/SF/ECT@ECT, \nccalger@enron.com, Jim Buerkle/PDX/ECT@ECT, Elliot Mainzer/PDX/ECT@ECT, \nJeffrey Oh/PDX/ECT@ECT, Todd Perry/PDX/ECT@ECT, Laird Dyer/SF/ECT@ECT, \nMichael McDonald/SF/ECT@ECT, Ed Clark/PDX/ECT@ECT, Dave Fuller/PDX/ECT@ECT, \nAlan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, John \nMalowney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stewart Rosman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Shields/PDX/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: New Generation Report for January 2001\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/499."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <9144576.1075855665395.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 17 Apr 2018 11:02:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: arsystem@mailman.enron.com\nTo: phillip.k.allen@enron.com\nSubject: Your Approval is Overdue: Access Request for\n barry.tycholiz@enron.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: ARSystem@mailman.enron.com\nX-To: phillip.k.allen@enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nThis request has been pending your approval for  2 days.

Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, \nTAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the \n       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and \nTAGG but the issues facing \n       scheduling in Unify are grey.\n\n2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the \"assume it is messed up\" \npolicy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need \nfurther      scrutiny.\n\n3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical \nimbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?\n\n4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training \ncourses, review progress and make cuts.\n\n5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at \neverything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add \n   some value and direction to the group.\n\n\nIn fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD \nto work part time to get it done.\n\nPhillip\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/508."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <22109164.1075855697228.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sat, 31 Mar 2018 03:05:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: body.shop@enron.com\nSubject: Re: FW: Change in the agroup Cycling Schedule\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Body Shop\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nThe spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles.

Their version includes the salary of a \nsuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third \nparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\" \nfees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be \npaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally \nthe builders profit of 1.4 million.\n\nKeith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out \nof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if \nthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  \nWe were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition \nto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been \nin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and \nthe superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management \nfee is included.\n\nGeorge gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will \nreview and let you know what I think.\n\nThe GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to \nthe 3 out 4 approval process.\n\nLet me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only \ntrue costs + 1.4 million.\n\nPhillip\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/514."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <2832535.1075855697356.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 18 Feb 2018 01:09:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: cbpres@austin.rr.com\nSubject: Re: DRAW2.xls\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nGeorge,\n\nPlease send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/515."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <26241958.1075855697378.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 12 Mar 2018 00:46:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jeanie.slone@enron.com\nSubject: \nCc: john.lavorato@enron.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nBcc: john.lavorato@enron.com\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Jeanie Slone\nX-cc: John J Lavorato\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nJeanie,\n\nLavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into \npart time.

The missing money on the \nspreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.\n\n2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?\n\n3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?\n\n4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?\n\n5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?\n\n6.  #14  missed on 2/2?\n\n7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?\n\n8.  #20a missed on 2/2?\n\n9.  #35 missed on 2/2?\n\nMy guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  \nYou may have sent me a message over the \"chat\" line that I don't remember on \nsome of these.

Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I \nwould like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax \nall invoices within 48 hours.

Exposure to interest fluctuations, the \nlarge cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer \nare the three biggest concerns.  \n\nWhat I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the \nbuyers choice of terms up to 30 years.

I have shifted \nto a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could \nnot work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more \ntowards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One \nwing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 \nkid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + \nguestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This \nplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the \ncourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor \nliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. \n The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass \nskylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have \nsingle slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  \n\nI don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would \nlike to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I \nwould like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I \nwould like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we \ndidn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. \n\nCall or email to let me know if this would work for you.  \npallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)\n\n\nPhillip Allen\n\n\nPS.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \nrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \ncost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \nrepairs.\n\n2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \nonsite.\n\n3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\n\n4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \nthis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\n\nMy job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property \ndefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.\n\n\nSales Price  705,000\n\n1st Lien   473,500\n\n2nd Lien  225,000\n\nTransfer fee    7,500\n\nCash required   14,500\n\n\nNOI   100,000\n\n1st Lien    47,292\n\n2nd Lien   23,694\n\nCash flow  29,014\n\nCash on cash  200%\n\n\nThese numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then \ncash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the \nadditional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years \nfor a higher price.\n\nDo you want to reconsider?  Let me know.\n\nPhillip\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/557."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <28218246.1075855698311.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 23 Jan 2018 23:14:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: mike.grigsby@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com\nSubject: Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG -- CPUC Audit Report on\n Edison\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/31/2001=\n=20\n07:12 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nSusan J Mara@ENRON\n01/30/2001 10:10 AM\nTo: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Angela Schwarz/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly=20\nAden/HOU/EES@EES, Bill Votaw/HOU/EES@EES, Brenda Barreda/HOU/EES@EES, Carol=\n=20\nMoffett/HOU/EES@EES, Cathy Corbin/HOU/EES@EES, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT,=\n=20\nChristina Liscano/HOU/EES@EES, Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Craig H=20\nSutter/HOU/EES@EES, Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES, Debora Whitehead/HOU/EES@EES,=20\nDennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, Don Black/HOU/EES@EES, Dorothy=20\nYoungblood/HOU/ECT@ECT, Douglas Huth/HOU/EES@EES, Edward=20\nSacks/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Eric Melvin/HOU/EES@EES, Erika Dupre/HOU/EES@EES,=\n=20\nEvan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Fran Deltoro/HOU/EES@EES, Frank W=20\nVickers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gayle W Muench/HOU/EES@EES, Ginger=20\nDernehl/NA/Enron@ENRON, Gordon Savage/HOU/EES@EES, Harold G=20\nBuchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@ENRON, Iris Waser/HOU/EES@EE=\nS,=20\nJames D Steffes/NA/Enron@ENRON, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, James=20\nWright/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Jeff Messina/HOU/EES@EE=\nS,=20\nJeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Jess Hewitt/HOU/EES@EES, Joe=20\nHartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kathy=20\nBass/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Ken Gustafson/HOU/EES@EES, Kevi=\nn=20\nHughes/HOU/EES@EES, Leasa Lopez/HOU/EES@EES, Leticia Botello/HOU/EES@EES,=\n=20\nMark S Muller/HOU/EES@EES, Marsha Suggs/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EE=\nS,=20\nMeredith M Eggleston/HOU/EES@EES, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael=20\nMann/HOU/EES@EES, Michelle D Cisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike M Smith/HOU/EES@EES=\n,=20\nmpalmer@enron.com, Neil Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Neil Hong/HOU/EES@EES, Paul=20\nKaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Paula Warren/HOU/EES@EES, Richard L=20\nZdunkewicz/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Leibert/HOU/EES@EES, Richard=20\nShapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rita Hennessy/NA/Enron@ENRON, Robert=20\nBadeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES, Rosalinda Tijerina/HOU/EES@EES,=\n=20\nSandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott=20\nGahn/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, Sharon Dick/HOU/EES@EES,=20\nskean@enron.com, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Leslie/HOU/EES@EES, Tas=\nha=20\nLair/HOU/EES@EES, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Terri Greenlee/NA/Enron@ENRON, Ti=\nm=20\nBelden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tony Spruiell/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES,=20\nVladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wanda Curry/HOU/EES@EES, William S=20\nBradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jubran Whalan/HOU/EES@EES, triley@enron.com, Richard =\nB=20\nSanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,=\n=20\ndwatkiss@bracepatt.com, rcarroll@bracepatt.com, Donna=20\nFulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, gfergus@brobeck.com, Kathryn=20\nCorbally/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bruno Gaillard/EU/Enron@Enron, Linda=20\nRobertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ren, Lazure/Western=\n=20\nRegion/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Michael Tribolet/Corp/Enron@Enron,=20\nPhillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B=20\nSanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, jklauber@llgm.com, Tamara Johnson/HOU/EES@EES, Robert =\nC=20\nWilliams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: =20\nSubject: Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG -- CPUC Audit Report on=20\nEdison\n\n\n----- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/NA/Enron on 01/30/2001 10:02 AM -----\n\n=09\"Daniel Douglass\" <Douglass@ArterHadden.com>\n=0901/30/2001 08:31 AM\n=09=09=20\n=09=09 To: <Barbara_Klemstine@apsc.com>, <berry@apx.com>, <dcazalet@apx.com=\n>,=20\n<billr@calpine.com>, <jackp@calpine.com>, <glwaas@calpx.com>,=20\n<Ken_Czarnecki@calpx.com>, <gavaughn@duke-energy.com>,=20\n<rjhickok@duke-energy.com>, <gtbl@dynegy.com>, <jmpa@dynegy.com>,=20\n<jdasovic@enron.com>, <susan_j_mara@enron.com>, <Tamara_Johnson@enron.com>,=\n=20\n<curt.Hatton@gen.pge.com>, <foothill@lmi.net>, <camiessn@newwestenergy.com>=\n,=20\n<jcgardin@newwestenergy.com>, <jsmollon@newwestenergy.com>,=20\n<rsnichol@newwestenergy.com>, <Curtis_L_Kebler@reliantenergy.com>,=20\n<rllamkin@seiworldwide.com>\n=09=09 cc:=20\n=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison\n\nThe following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=\nit=20\nreport on Southern California Edison:\n=20\nI. Cash Needs\nHighlights:\nSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\nplete=20\ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\ns=20\nand other measures.=20\nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\n.8=20\nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\nII. Credit Relationships\nHighlights:\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\nSCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\nlt.=20\nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\nnd=20\npayable.\nSCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\n=20\nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\nits=20\nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\n=20\nissues within the last three weeks.\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\nHighlights\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\nvarious price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\n such=20\nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\nHighlights\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\n=20\nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\nTotal                                             $ 460\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\n=20\nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\nom=20\ncontract employees.\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\n=20\nmost part being deferred to a future date.\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\nsavings of approximately $92 million.\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\nActivity)\nHighlights:\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\n=20\nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\ne=20\nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\n=20\nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\nD.01-01-018.\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20\ntracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20\nexpressed in the TRA, are overstated.\nTURN Proposal\nAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=\nRN=20\nto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=\ns.=20\nOur comments are summarized as follows:\nThe Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=\nt=20\nwould not directly generate nor use cash.\nThe Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=\nift=20\ncosts between two regulatory assets.\nTURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=\n the=20\nrevenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =\nin=20\nthe TRA is overstated.\nVI. Flow of Funds Analysis\nHighlights:\nIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=\n=20\npositive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\nDuring the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=\n=20\nits parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\nEdison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=\n=20\nshareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=\non=20\nstock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=\nve=20\nand general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\n[there is no Section VII]\n=20\nVIII. Earnings of California Affiliates\nSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=\n=20\nmillion annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20\nIn 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=\n=20\nThis increase correlates to the increase in market prices\nfor natural gas for the same period.\nA copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20\nwww.cpuc.ca.gov.\n=20\nDan\n\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/558."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <5722531.1075855698441.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 18 Feb 2018 16:00:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: c@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: C\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nGeorge,\n\nIn response to your ideas\n\nTime and cost\n\n1.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially \ncomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with \nthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of \nwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who \nswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the \nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \n(and maybe earlier).\n\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \nForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get \nsome assurances of payment. \n\nSCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due \non 2/2/01.\n\nFor gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's \npurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements \n(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be \nresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this \noccurred today.\n\nStatus of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will \nhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  \nPlan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .

Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\n\"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, \na trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \n\nBut the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\n\"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting,\" McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \nfingers at Wall Street. \n\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for \nthe rise in gas prices. \n\n\"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \n\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \n\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \nfor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \n\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \nprices before they soared. \n\n\"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \n\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \n\n\"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \nchange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \n\n\nHot topic \n\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \nmany circles, little else is discussed. \n\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \nprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \ncustomers. \n\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \nfor winter. \n\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \nmarkets. \n\n\"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \ncommodity in the world. \n\n\nSetting the price \n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \nwidespread influence over gas prices. \n\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \n\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \nof natural gas. \n\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \ntheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \nin a short time. \n\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \nweekly storage numbers. \n\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \nneed in the winter. \n\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \nhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \nsufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \nassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n\nBut some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n\n\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n\nThen suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \nWednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n\n\nJust passing through \n\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \npass their fuel costs on to customers. \n\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \nenergy. \n\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \n\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \ncosts. \n\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \n\n\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider \nsome changes.\" \n\n\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \nseverly@kcstar.com. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star  ", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/578."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <9664038.1075855698885.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 13 Mar 2018 00:38:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Please respond\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nmessage board", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/579."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <12779248.1075855666764.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 10 Apr 2018 04:04:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: paula.harris@enron.com\nSubject: Re: West Gas Trading 2001 Plan\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Paula Harris\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nPaula,\n\n I looked over the plan.

Note that the\nconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\nstandard rate of 10%.

Additional revenues could be generated by building detached\ngarages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat\n", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/59."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <29620511.1075855699125.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 20 Feb 2018 05:18:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: james.steffes@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: James D Steffes\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nJim,\n\nHere are the key gas contacts.\n\n   Work   Home   Cell\n\nPhillip Allen  X37041   713-463-8626  713-410-4679\n\nMike Grigsby  X37031   713-780-1022  713-408-6256\n\nKeith Holst  X37069   713-667-5889  713-502-9402\n\n\nPlease call me with any significant developments.\n\nPhillip ", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/590."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <13595482.1075855699169.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 16 Feb 2018 06:18:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nSubject: updated lease information\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLucy,\n\nThe apartments that have new tenants since December 15th are:  \n1,2,8,12,13,16,20a,20b,25,32,38,39.\n\nAre we running an apartment complex or a motel?\n\nPlease update all lease information on the 1/12 rentroll and email it to me \nthis afternoon.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/592."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <27146733.1075855699190.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 21 Jan 2018 05:49:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: llewter@austin.rr.com\nSubject: Re: Wiring instructions\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: \"Larry Lewter\" <llewter@austin.rr.com> @ ENRON\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLarry,\n\nDo you want the loan and wire amount to be for exactly $1.1 million.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/593."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <15534566.1075855699212.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 10 Apr 2018 22:57:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ben.jacoby@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Analyst PRC\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ben Jacoby\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nThanks for representing Matt.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/594."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <2422582.1075855699234.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 16 Apr 2018 09:51:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: cbpres@austin.rr.com\nSubject: Re: SM134\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: <cbpres@austin.rr.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nGeorge,\n\nHere is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders \nprofit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but \ncould be as favorable as 55/45.

In attendance were Ken Lay, \nthe Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \nproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \nbased on the governor's comments:\n\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \nthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.

The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in \nSan Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a \ncouple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like \nto find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not \nrequire the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to \nstructure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has \nbeen mentioned is to obtain a \"forward commitment\" in order to reduce the \nequity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this \nnature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to \npermanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be \nimportant to banks. \n\n I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer \nemail or fax his financial statement to you.\n\n Let me know what else you need.

If \nyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as recommendations, here is a short list:\n\n 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales \nabove monthly index without enough consideration of future \n      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \ninjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\n                    This creates a shortage in later months.\n\n 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \ndemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  \n                      Specific questions should include:  \n\n  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order \nto fill storage?\n\n  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \nmuch gas from Socal's system.  \n       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their \nown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than \ntheir injection capablity, but injected far less.\n\n 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short \nterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major \n                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating \nrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market \nand the \n     consumer has benefitted.  \n\n\nCall me if you need any more input.\n\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/610."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <30222430.1075855699581.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 19 Jan 2018 01:54:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jason.moore@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Global Ids\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Jason Moore\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nMonique Sanchez\n\nJay Reitmeyer\n\nRandy Gay\n\nMatt Lenhart", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/611."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <1395933.1075855699603.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 25 Mar 2018 01:21:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jonathan.mckay@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Jonathan McKay\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nJohn,\n\nHere is our North of Stanfield forecast for Jan.\n\n\nSupply    Jan '01   Dec '00   Jan '00\n\n Sumas   900   910   815\n Jackson Pr.  125    33   223\n Roosevelt  300   298   333\n \n Total Supply  1325   1241   1371\n\nDemand\n North of Chehalis 675   665   665\n South of Chehalis 650   575   706\n\n Total Demand  1325   1240   1371\n\nRoosevelt capacity is 495.\n\nLet me know how your forecast differs.\n\n\nPhillip  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "file": "allen-p/all_documents/612."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <6900600.1075855699625.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 19 Jan 2018 07:57:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: dawn.kenne@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Global Ids\nCc: mary.gosnell@enron.com, jason.moore@enron.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nBcc: mary.gosnell@enron.com, jason.moore@enron.com\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Dawn C Kenne\nX-cc: Mary G Gosnell, Jason Moore\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nPlease assign global id's to the four junior traders listed on Dawn's \noriginal email.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion fo=\nr the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period =\nin 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third qua=\nrter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$85=\n4 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions=\n and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for th=\ne third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, c=\nompared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common =\nshare on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.

During th=\ne third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implemen=\nt its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The=\n Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b=\nreak even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structu=\nre is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.\"   Frank Dunn, =\nthe Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November =\n1, 2001, said, \"Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organiz=\nation to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks=\n, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services an=\nd voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless N=\networks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product progra=\nms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p=\nortfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help=\n them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct=\nions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor=\ntunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 day=\ns included:         --  the First North American ILEC began the circuit to =\npacket         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         =\nsoftswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe =\nand         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP,=\n MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G=\n Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the fir=\nst commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP c=\nall;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated  =\n       Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge        =\n Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanc=\ned software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX =\n        solution.\"    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects =\nto have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o=\nf its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction=\ns are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A =\nworkforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart=\ner of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continu=\ne to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The numbe=\nr of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including=\n the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul=\ntimately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the =\nquarter, Frank Dunn said, \"We are extremely pleased with the results that h=\nave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi=\ncant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio=\nns. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by=\n completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which=\n, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati=\nons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan=\nced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and action=\ns we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet i=\ns well positioned.\"   \"While we believe we are beginning to see early indic=\nations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl=\ne levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the u=\nncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa=\nke of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu=\nsinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua=\nrter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,\" concluded Dunn.         R=\nevenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure reven=\nues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third=\n quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =\nand slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =\nin Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=\nrope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=\nurope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet=\n revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and =\nLatin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photon=\nic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=\nmpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=\nargely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=\ny solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=\nd 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Su=\nbstantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and st=\nrong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable decl=\nines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wire=\nless OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on =\nOctober 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Netwo=\nrks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks wil=\nl evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning =\nin the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter =\nof 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the Uni=\nted States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States a=\nnd Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001,=\n revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$1=\n9.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuin=\ng operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or U=\nS$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 bill=\nion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in=\n 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations=\n, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions=\n and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intang=\nible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US=\n$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending=\n Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its c=\nost structure. Compared to the Company's year-end 2000 cost structure, excl=\nusive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure a=\nt the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billi=\non.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was =\napproximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$=\n750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the exp=\nected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Exclud=\ning the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gro=\nss margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compa=\nred to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expe=\nnses    Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in the third =\nquarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=\njustments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condit=\nion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=\nated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=\nisions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =\nto second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=\nearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=\nrter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=\no drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=\nion of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001,=\n R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100=\n million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operation=\ns.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (\"NNL\"), Nortel Ne=\ntworks Corporation's principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated=\n into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly =\ntraded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring c=\nharge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workfor=\nce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business str=\neamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the a=\npproximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonic=\ns Components business. All such amounts are included in the consolidated No=\nrtel Networks amounts described above.

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.\n \nWe are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.\n \nIf you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.\n \nThank you for your support.\n \nEnron Global Technology\n \n \n \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration \nSent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM \nTo: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON \nCc: \nSubject: Supported Internet Email Addresses\n\n\n\nEnron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.\n\nAny new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\n\nTo determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.\n\nIMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards.

Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:\n\n\tISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).\n\tAny unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).\n\tInformation related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).\n\nAll in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.

You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy =\nplayers just like yourself!   =09\n\n\n  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=\n start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=\nrry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =\nStaley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=\nr - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=\nnst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=\nnd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=\n not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=\no go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =\ngoing with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=\nnswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=\nina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but=\n Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=\n best, so our hands are tied.  =09\n\n\n  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=\nis week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=\ne. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=\nent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =\nfacing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=\n like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=\nig game.  =09\n\n\n  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=\nnon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=\nohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=\nailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=\nn the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=\nrpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=\nghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =\ncurrent pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =\ngood enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=\n will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=\nother No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=\nntasy player.  =09\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =\ngiving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=\nn the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=\nfter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=\n will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09\n\n\n  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Interesting.\n\nKen\n\nIndigestion \nDaniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 \n\nAll those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.\nFor natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. \n\nAh, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. \n\nStudness determined that 79% of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. \n\nCoal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. \n\n \nAddressing a Burning Issue \nIf natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  \n  \n\nWINNERS  \t\t\tSales* ($bil) \tRemarks \nCalpine \t\t\t\t$4.6 \t\tIts gas power plants won't compete with coal for years \nChesapeake Energy \t\t0.9 \t\tHedged gas production through December 2003 \nDynegy \t\t\t43.4 \t\tOwns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas \nPeabody Energy \t\t2.7 \t\tWorld's largest coal company \n\nLOSERS  \t\t\tSales* ($bil) \tRemarks \nDevon Energy \t\t\t3.3 Gas-heavy; \t$8 billion in ...debt  \nGeneral Electric \t\t129.5 \t\tSells gas turbines \nPioneer Natural Resources \t1.0 \t\t$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas \nTransocean SedcoForex \t1.9 \t\t$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure \n   \n*Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. \n\n\"It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,\" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. \"It's our game to displace older gas.\" \n\nCombined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. \n\nThat scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are \"huge capital hogs,\" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. \n\nBut coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. \n\nLong term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire. \n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/124."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <33087485.1075858633102.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:11:38 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: chad.landry@enron.com\nTo: k..allen@enron.com\nSubject: workout\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Landry, Chad </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=CLANDRY>\nX-To: Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pallen>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nwill you be ready to hit the weights on monday.  i have not been going in the morning b/c i am too lazy to wake up, especially if i do not have a partner.  you could do rehab excercises and I could run from 540-6 and then we could workout from 6-645.  are you ready for that?\n\nckl", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/125."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <3760168.1075858633127.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 11 Apr 2018 04:55:34 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: no.address@enron.com\nSubject: All-Employee Meeting\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Public Relations@ENRON\nX-To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON <??SAll Enron Worldwide@ENRON>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nThe All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  \n\nAs one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=\nercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=\nn, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on e=\nquity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=\nected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge=\n of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =\nSeptember 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=\nertain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisio=\nns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=\nnsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =\nof these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=\n-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=\n September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=\ny, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=\n of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=\ne company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =\nexpenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra =\noperating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=\ned. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=\n will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=\nludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=\nsset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=\nganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=\nn certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=\nns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=\nocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=\nted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=\ntion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=\nf improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=\nted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=\nities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=\n on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=\nr and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =\n  Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=\ntime costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =\n19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=\nnt. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   \"While we w=\nere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=\nrist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =\nwe saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=\nestment activity slowed after September 11th,\" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=\nairman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. \"In light of =\nthe weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=\n our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=\nitiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=\nes with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=\nnefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=\nhise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=\n the economy.\"   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=\ne of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=\n year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=\n million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=\nd in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=\ne costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=\ntacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income =\nwould have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=\near.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=\nues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =\n28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=\nase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=\ne September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=\nr was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=\net a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=\narge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=\nlds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=\nuctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=\n.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =\nhigher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=\nncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=\nin marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=\n expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=\nss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=\ning and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results \"=\non a managed basis\" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=\nich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=\nlts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=\nrmats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of=\n $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=\nillion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=\nse gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=\n therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=\nan Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =\nmillion, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=\n Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=\n62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=\nd earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=\ns directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net inc=\nome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=\nsults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =\nthe investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =\nlower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=\nagement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=\ning the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=\n primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=\ncontrol initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=\n company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=\nies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=\nion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=\nlio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=\nrted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=\nncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=\n ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=\nng these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximate=\nly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=\nustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=\n, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=\nsts did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflec=\nt strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=\nsults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =\nas a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=\ngher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=\nalances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =\nto shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=\nrporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=\nillion a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million p=\nre-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.   =\nAmerican Express Company (http://www.americanexpress.com ), founded in 1850=\n, is a global travel, financial and network services provider.

We pretty much make whatever you \nwould like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are \ndurable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner \nis rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only \ncharged for the materials.\n\nOur most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most \neconomical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a \ngiven site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar \nstyle grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have \nusually build them with a 3'-10 1/2\" wide door opening.  I would think that \nwould be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your \ndad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold \nover 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually \nvaries between $800 and $900.\n\n\n\nYour dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is \na bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum \nsoffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe \nPronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize \nand legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your \ndad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.\nThe picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently \nbuilding a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up \ndoor.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be \nroughly $1500.\n\n\nWe will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your \nneeds.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the \neasiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday \nOctober 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to \nfinish that one on time.\n\nIf you have any questions just e-mail me or call:\n\tWhitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364\n\tMy Home number 715-985-3063.\n\nHave a good one and take with you later.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMel Nelson", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/149."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <11718365.1075855374891.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 15 Mar 2018 21:25:17 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: gift@amazon.com\nTo: pallen@enron.com\nSubject: Save Big at Our Clearance Event\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Amazon.com\" <gift@amazon.com>@ENRON\nX-To: pallen@enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Jan2002_1\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n[IMAGE] \t\n\n\n    [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]Explore  more savings .....

No hand-outs were provided.\n\nCalculation of Receipt Point Capacity\nTopock  540 mmcf/d\nEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/d\nNeedles 800 mmcf/d\nWheeler 800 mmcf/d\n\nNew Receipt Points\nKramer Junction 200 mmcf/d\nHector Rd 50 mmcf/d\nBoth will be available around Feb 1\n\nBasis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation\nCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.\n\nNew Calculation, Changes and Display\nBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.\n\nOFO Declaration\nName changes from overnomination\nCan declare before any Cycle\nProvide 2 hour notice\nPost on Gas Select\nShow OFO Calculation on Gas Select\n\nWindows\nReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system\nCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   \nDue to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  \nReplace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's\nNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.\n\nScheduling Changes-Nov 1\nGas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     \nRollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle\nCopy confirmed noms\nAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.\n\n2 Hour Notice\nSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.\nOFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  \n\nScheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO\nNominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  \nExpected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.\nNo interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.\nUse Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules\nExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.\nFlow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  \nIf call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.\nMany people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  \nIf OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:\n\nCycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut\nCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut\nCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut\nWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  \nFor OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.\n\nFor an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:\n\n         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes\nCycle 1                                    Cycle 2\nCycle 2                                     Intraday 1\nCycle 3\t\t\t\tevening cyle 2 on 10/4\nCycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4\n\nIn other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.\n\nWinter Balancing Rules\nEffective Nov 1-March 31\nNo changes.\nAll customers must comply.\nMinimum delivery requirements\n50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)\n70% of daily usage depending on storage level\n70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min\n90% of daily usage depending on storage level\n90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.\nLook at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.\nMust increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.\nOnce 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,\n\nContracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.\n\nCore Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  \nCore-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)\nNot subject to 70% and 90% rules.\n\n2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.\n\nBurn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,\nMin DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.\n\nCustomer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.\n\n\nOFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/158."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <28563499.1075858634353.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 15 Jan 2018 13:05:57 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: randy.bhatia@enron.com\nTo: k..allen@enron.com\nSubject: RE:\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Bhatia, Randy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=RBHATIA>\nX-To: Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pallen>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nphillip.\n\nlooking into it now, i'll move them.\n\n-rb\n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tAllen, Phillip K.  \nSent:\tTuesday, October 23, 2001 3:00 PM\nTo:\tBhatia, Randy\nSubject:\t\n\nRandy,\n\nWhy is there a PG&E Citygate position in Mgmt-West?

Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt\n\nIn addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc\n\n\tAfter sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:\n?\tSmall story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)\n?\tResources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)\n?\tOrder and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)\n\nChanges to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. \n\n\nIssue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. \n\nThanks.

Thanks for the update.  I have been talking\nwith contractors and Spring Valley.  At this point we are trying to\ndetermine whether the addition over the garage would be workable.  Heather\nprobably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home\nto get a firm bid on the project.  I spoke today with the Spring Valley\nbuilding consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of\npossible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance\nfrom the decision makers when the time comes.\n\nIn the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers\ndisclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final\nword from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have some\nnew information.\n\nThanks,\n\nBob Huntley\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com>\nTo: <wise.counsel@lpl.com>\nSent: Thursday, October 18, 2001 9:18 AM\nSubject: RE: Huntley followup question\n\n\nBob,\n\nI do have a survey of the sight at home.

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:\n\nProducer/Wellhead Group \nThe current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.\n\nStrategic Asset  Development\nLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.\n\nCentral Origination and Mid-Market\nFrank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. \n \n\nThere will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. \n\nPlease join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.\n\nLouise & John", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/191."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <2047280.1075858635378.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 2 Jan 2018 18:45:18 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: ryan.o'rourke@enron.com\nTo: k..allen@enron.com, tom.alonso@enron.com, robert.badeer@enron.com, \n\teric.bass@enron.com, tim.belden@enron.com, chad.clark@enron.com, \n\tmike.cowan@enron.com, chris.dorland@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com, \n\th..foster@enron.com, l..gay@enron.com, mike.grigsby@enron.com, \n\tmog.heu@enron.com, keith.holst@enron.com, jason.huang@enron.com, \n\ttori.kuykendall@enron.com, matthew.lenhart@enron.com, \n\tt..lucci@enron.com, chris.mallory@enron.com, a..martin@enron.com, \n\tstephanie.miller@enron.com, matt.motley@enron.com, \n\tjay.reitmeyer@enron.com, monique.sanchez@enron.com, \n\tm..scott@enron.com, matt.smith@enron.com, p..south@enron.com, \n\tmike.swerzbin@enron.com, m..tholt@enron.com, \n\tbarry.tycholiz@enron.com, houston <.ward@enron.com>, \n\tmark.whitt@enron.com, jason.wolfe@enron.com\nSubject: West NatGas Prices 1024\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: O'Rourke, Ryan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ROROURKE>\nX-To: Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pallen>, Alonso, Tom </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Talonso>, Badeer, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbadeer>, Bass, Eric </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ebass>, Belden, Tim </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tbelden>, Clark, Chad </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cclark5>, Cowan, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mcowan1>, Dorland, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cdorlan>, Ermis, Frank </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fermis>, Foster, Chris H. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cfoster>, Gay, Randall L. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rgay>, Grigsby, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgrigsb>, Heu, Mog </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=b5b64a78-ae842218-86256923-734572>, Holst, Keith </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kholst>, Huang, Jason </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhuang>, Kuykendall, Tori </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tkuyken>, Lenhart, Matthew </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mlenhar>, Lucci, Paul T. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Plucci>, Mallory, Chris </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cmallor>, Martin, Thomas A. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tmartin>, Miller, Stephanie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Smiller2>, Motley, Matt </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmotley>, Reitmeyer, Jay </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jreitme>, Sanchez, Monique </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Msanch2>, Scott, Susan M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sscott5>, Smith, Matt </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Msmith18>, South, Steven P. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ssouth>, Swerzbin, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mswerzb>, Tholt, Jane M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtholt>, Tycholiz, Barry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Btychol>, Ward, Kim S (Houston) </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kward>, Whitt, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mwhitt>, Wolfe, Jason </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jwolfe>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nNotice Phy & Fin Index tabs have been added...\n\n ", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/192."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <15350054.1075858635401.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 13 Apr 2018 18:39:57 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: members@realmoney.com\nTo: members@realmoney.com\nSubject: Have you checked your credit rating lately?\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: <members@realmoney.com>@ENRON\nX-To: members@realmoney.com <prod-special@pbulk01.thestreet.com>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n\nTheStreet.com and Privista are pleased to present you with\nCredit Insight.

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  \n\nJeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.\n\nI know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.\n\nPlease join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/197."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <13417244.1075858635561.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 17 Apr 2018 13:43:14 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: webmaster@earnings.com\nTo: pallen@enron.com\nSubject: Reminder: AMGN Q3 Earnings Announcement on October 25, 2001\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: \"Earnings.com\" <webmaster@earnings.com>@ENRON\nX-To: pallen@enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nIf you cannot read this email, please click here .=20\n\nEarnings.com - AMGN Earnings Detail\nEarnings.com =09[IMAGE] =09\n=09  Amgen Inc.(AMGN)              [IMAGE] View Today's Earnings Announceme=\nnts        Earnings Date Upcoming Announcement October 25, 2001  BEFORE MAR=\nKET    Add This Event To My Calendar    Upcoming Conference Call October 25=\n, 2001 5:00PM [IMAGE]  Add This Event To My Calendar  Last Conference Call =\nJuly 26, 2001 5:00PM Click To Listen       Last Earnings Headline    Octobe=\nr 18, 2001 4:11 PM - Amgen Announces Webcast of Third-Quarter 2001 Earnings=\n  - BUSINESS WIRE  Note: All times are Eastern Standard Time (EST)     Cons=\nensus EPS Estimate This Qtr Jun 2001 Next Qtr Sep 2001 This Fiscal Year Dec=\n 2001 Next Fiscal Year Dec 2002 Avg Estimatem (mean) $0.28 $0.30 $1.17 $1.4=\n1 # of Estimates 22 20 24 24 Low Estimate $0.25 $0.27 $1.13 $1.26 High Esti=\nmate $0.29 $0.32 $1.19 $1.58 Year Ago EPS $0.28 $0.29 $1.05 $1.17 EPS Growt=\nh 0.81% 2.41% 11.63% 20.33%    Quarterly Earnings Mar 2001 Dec 2000 Sep 200=\n0 Jun 2000 Mar 2000 Estimate EPS $0.27 $0.25 $0.27 $0.27 $0.25 Actual EPS $=\n0.28 $0.24 $0.29 $0.28 $0.25 Difference $0.01 -$0.01 $0.02 $0.01 $0.00 % Su=\nrprise 3.70% -4.00% 7.41% 3.70% 0.00%    Earnings Growth Last 5 Years This =\nFiscal Year Next Fiscal Year Ave Est Next 5 Years P/E (FY 2001) PEG Ratio A=\nMGN Industry Rank: 85 of 160 16.50% 11.63% 20.33% 20.02% 48.77 2.44 INDUSTR=\nY  MED-BIOMED/GEN 29.30% 11.30% 26.70% 34.80% 1.07 1.65 SECTOR MEDICAL     =\n         -28.68% 4.98% 75.85% 25.66% -5.56 0.45 S&P 500 8.40% -4.20% 14.60%=\n 17.00% 22.15 1.31    Long-term Growth Avg Est High Est Low Est Estimates A=\nMGN  20.02%  30.30%  15.00%  13      Covering Analysts:   View History     =\nA.G.

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.\n\nBeginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: \n\n1.\tPlease dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    \n2.\tYou will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. \n3.\tYou will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.\n  \nThis procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.\n  \nIf you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.

I hope all is going well. \n\nIf I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. \n\nGood news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks\n\nCheers\nKirk\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 10/23/2001 03:35 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nKirk McDaniel\n10/19/2001 08:27 AM\nTo:\tPhillip K Allen/Enron@EnronXGate, Tim O'Rourke/Enron@EnronXGate, Yevgeny Frolov/Enron@EnronXGate\ncc:\tEd McMichael/Enron@EnronXGate, Dutch Quigley/Enron@EnronXGate \nSubject:\tRevised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance\n\nPhillip/Tim/Yevgeny\nPlease review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.\n\nPhillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt\n\nIn addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc\n\n\tAfter sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:\n?\tSmall story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)\n?\tResources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)\n?\tOrder and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)\n\nChanges to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. \n\n\nIssue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. \n\nThanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.\n\nCheers\nKirk\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 10/19/2001 07:58 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nmery.l.brown@accenture.com on 10/18/2001 12:46:06 PM\nTo:\tkmcdani@enron.com\ncc:\tdonald.l.barnhart@accenture.com, laura.a.de.la.torre@accenture.com \nSubject:\tRevised High Level Design\n\n\nKirk,\n\nAttached are the latest High Level Design and Flow Chart with revisions\nbased on Tim's and your comments.

Curious to hear any perspectives you may\nwish to offer from the trading floor?  Enron stock is now lower than when I\njoined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a few\nnot so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPW\nwith a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowing\nyou, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down\nmuch.

Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  \t\n\n\n  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  \t\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.  \t\n\n\n  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

For assistance, please call 1-800-934-4448, press  4 then 4 =\nto speak with a Retirement Plans Specialist.  Restraints  Will Be Overcome =\n We see an  irregular upward trend in the market.  Stocks  face some formid=\nable hurdles. The risk of additional terrorism  and fresh memories of the m=\narket's 18-month downward spiral are  inhibiting buying. So are dismal four=\nth-quarter earnings pre-announcements  as the economic cycle approaches bot=\ntom, as well as continued  high P/E ratios on recession-depressed profits. =\nIn addition, the  supply of stock for sale at prices just above current lev=\nels is  heavy, according to technical analysts.   But  we expect that these=\n and other impediments will be overcome. And  we note that market recoverie=\ns that proceed in halting fashion  amid widespread skepticism often are the=\n most sustainable.  Congress's  failure to pass a fiscal stimulus bill is n=\not a major negative,  according to S&P chief economist David Wyss. The econ=\nomy will  recover anyway, says Wyss, with absence of the package pinching  =\nGDP growth in 2002 by only 0.2%. Without fiscal stimulus, the  chances of a=\n 12th fed funds rate cut on January 30 are improved.    Based  on Wyss's fo=\nrecast of GDP turning positive in the first quarter  and improving to an an=\nnual growth rate of 5% in the fourth quarter,  investors should be getting =\nmore encouraging news before long.    The  recent rally lost upward momentu=\nm when it bumped up against overhead  resistance at 1170 on the S&P 500 on =\nDecember 5. With the  help of turn-of-the-year reinvestment demand, the nex=\nt attempt  to work through this supply is likely to be more successful, say=\ns  Mark Arbeter, S&P chief technical analyst. But even if it  is, the area =\nof resistance runs all the way up to 1313, so Arbeter  believes further pro=\ngress in the period ahead will be labored.    We  think the S&P 500 and Nas=\ndaq will see double-digit gains over  the course of 2002. A portfolio alloc=\nation of 65% stocks, 20%  bonds and 15% cash reserves remains appropriate. =\n As  a TD Waterhouse customer, you can view a complete copy of S&P's  The O=\nutlook (a $298 value) for FREE.

Pat thinks that if this holiday\n    generated so much holiday cheer, just\n    wait 'til next year.

As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. \n\nOccupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South\nYou will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.\n\nNEC Monitors\nThe NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.\n\nTurret Users\nAn \"Alliance MX turret quick reference guide\" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as \"Caller ID\" and \"Voicemail Indication\".\n\nIncreased Information Access\nThere are many NEC 50\" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:\n\nTen audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:\n \nChannel\tAvaya\tStentophon\t\nWeather Channel\t12401\t801\t\nCNN Headlines News\t12402\t802\t\nCNN Financial News\t12403\t803\t\nCNBC\t12404\t804\t\nMSNBC\t12405\t805\t\nBloomberg\t12406\t806\t\nFinancial News Network\t12407\t807\t\nCNN\t12408\t808\t\nFox Sports\t12409\t809\t\nESPN1\t12410\t810\t\n\n\nWireless Telephony\nYou may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.

We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.\n\nAmtel Replacement\nAs a move to provide a more flexible \"Plug n Play\" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.\n\nKeeping an Open forum\nWe will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/341."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <18680340.1075862160893.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 9 Jan 2018 12:11:14 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: e-mail.center@wsj.com\nTo: business_alert@listserv.dowjones.com\nSubject: BUSINESS ALERT: Phillips, Conoco to Merge\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"WSJ.com Editors\" <e-mail.center@WSJ.COM>\nX-To: BUSINESS_ALERT@LISTSERV.DOWJONES.COM\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n__________________________________\nBUSINESS ALERT\nfrom The Wall Street Journal\n\n\nSunday, Nov. 18, 2001\n\nPhillips Petroleum and Conoco agreed to merge, the energy companies\nannounced Sunday afternoon.\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://interactive.wsj.com/articles/SB1006111331760480320.htm\n\n\n__________________________________\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn IBM e(logo)server pSeries solution for\ne-business infrastructure can meet the needs\nof the toughest financial environment.\nNow at savings up to $33,000.\nLearn more, and receive a complimentary report on IT security:\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/eserver/unix/security/l-18\n\n__________________________________\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nTO REMOVE YOURSELF from this list, see:\n\n<http://interactive.wsj.com/user-cgi-bin/searchUser.pl?action=emailalert>\nhttp://interactive.wsj.com/user-cgi-bin/searchUser.pl?action=emailalert\n\nThen uncheck the appropriate box to unsubscribe from this list.

We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \t[IMAGE]\tInside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t\n\n\n [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t\n\n\n    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \t\n\n\n    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  \t\n\n\n    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t\n\n\n  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \t\n\n\n  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   \t\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday.

It was  intro=\nduced back in 1983 as a boxy hatchback and sedan that quickly became  known=\n for its eminent practicality and bulletproof reliability. Subsequent  gene=\nrations became larger and more powerful, with the Camry line expanding  to =\ninclude a wagon and a coupe. Toyota designed it to appeal to as many  buyer=\ns as possible, and buyers responded by making the Camry one of  America's b=\nest-selling vehicles.   For 2002, the Camry has been completely redesigned =\non a brand-new platform.  The new generation is being sold solely as a four=\n-door sedan, although last  year's Camry Solara continues as a coupe and co=\nnvertible. Toyota claims  that the new Camry's design is both sportier and =\nmore personal than the  sedans that came before. We evaluated a Camry XLE t=\no find out if Toyota hit  its mark.

Gradual  Uptrend=\n Anticipated By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   We see further  but sl=\nower market progress.  Tired  after their recent run, stocks nevertheless a=\nre being supported  by signs that the economy is stabilizing, better news f=\nrom Afghanistan  and a large pool of cash reserves earning meager returns. =\nThe  two-steps-forward, one-step-backward recovery since September  21 hasn=\n't created the enthusiasm that would necessitate an early,  nasty correctio=\nn. Investors, keeping in mind that every rally  of the past 19 months has u=\nltimately failed, are regaining their  confidence only slowly.  Background =\n conditions don't lend themselves to a strong advance in the near  term. Wh=\nile recent data suggest that the recession will be mild  and will end early=\n next year, risks to this forecast are high.  Another terrorist attack coul=\nd deepen consumer gloom. The possibility  of the disruption of oil supplies=\n still exists. The fiscal stimulus  package continues to be bogged down in =\npartisan bickering.   Treasury  bond yields, moreover, have turned sharply =\nhigher, spurred by  the less dire economic reports and by chart breakouts. =\nYields  have quickly retraced the September-October decline.  S&P  technica=\nl analyst Mark Arbeter is impressed by the recent stock  market action and =\nanticipates higher levels over the intermediate  term, but he believes the =\neasiest and quickest gains are behind.  Arbeter sees a likely substantial a=\nmount of stock for sale when  Nasdaq (currently at 1898) moves into the 192=\n0 to 2300 range and  the S&P 500 (now at 1139) reaches 1170 to 1300. He exp=\nects  it will take time to chew through this supply.  History  also suggest=\ns limited near-term upside potential. Three months  after the low points of=\n the nine postwar bear markets, the S&P  500 was up an average of 14.9%. Th=\ne index is already up 18% since  the September 21 low. Six months after the=\n nine postwar bear market  lows, however, the \"500\" showed an average gain =\nof 24.4%;  12 months after the lows, the index was ahead 34.5%, on average.=\n  As  a TD Waterhouse customer, you can view a complete copy of S&P's  The =\nOutlook (a $298 value) for FREE.

It is\nbeing offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the\nGMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.\n\nCourse details:\n     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron\n\t\temployees\n     - Each course is limited to eight students\n     - Meets once a week for eight weeks\n     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to\n          include initial exam)\n     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week\n     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams\n     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the\n          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.\n     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition\n\nEnron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for\nconvenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their\nown fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is\nsubject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and\nrelevance to organizational performance.\n\n\nHOW TO ENROLL:\n     1.  Print out the attached registration form.\n     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following\n          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:\n          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including\n               your email address.\n          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says \"Please enroll\n               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________\",\n          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the\n               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.\n               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is\nrequired on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder\ninformation.\n     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.\n\nFaxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.\nThe first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be\nhonored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a\nwaiting\nlist for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be\nconfirmed by email.\n\nEmployees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at\nthe Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  \nCall (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.\n\nIMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:\n     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business\nschool.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic\nthat admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work\nexperience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of\nyour application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can\nsubstantially improve in a short period of time.\n\nTHE TEXAS MBA TOUR:\n     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA\nTour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA\nTour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business\nschools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.

That is an interesting idea.  I'd like to keep the rear stairway\nbut that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with the\nvariance.  I appreciate your efforts.\n\nBy the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?\n\nBob\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com>\nTo: <wise.counsel@lpl.com>\nSent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 8:19 AM\nSubject: RE: word file as promised\n\n\nBob,\n\nI turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be\non January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,\nthe application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression\nthat yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.\n\nOn another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful\nsuggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition\nforward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new\nspace.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use\nthe new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the\nexisting play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that\nis bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be\nused for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would\nnot have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the\nplayroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you could\nslope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place a\nlarge dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.\n>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your\ndrawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below\nthe addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the\ndriveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the house\nso that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen\nto the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, I\nthink opening the dining room would be the better idea.\n\nI don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in\nexploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest\nsomething in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me\nto try and sketch out these ideas.\n\nPhillip\n      -----Original Message-----\n     From:   \"Robert W.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.\n\nAfter weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.\n\nKen Lay", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/366."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <5815374.1075862161668.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 12 Jan 2018 17:22:56 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: arsystem@mailman.enron.com\nTo: k..allen@enron.com\nSubject: Your Approval is Overdue: Access Request for matt.smith@enron.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: ARSystem <ARSystem@mailman.enron.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PALLEN>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nThis request has been pending your approval for  29 days.

Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t\n\n\n [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t\n\n\n    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  \t\n\n\n    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  \t\n\n\n    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t\n\n\n  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  \t\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.  \t\n\n\n  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.\n\n?\tClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.\n?\tMatching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.\n\nWe regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.\n  ", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/399."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <31429551.1075855374433.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 8 Jan 2018 17:19:45 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: arsystem@mailman.enron.com\nTo: k..allen@enron.com\nSubject: Your Approval is Overdue: Access Request for matt.smith@enron.com\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: ARSystem <ARSystem@mailman.enron.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PALLEN>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Jan2002_1\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nThis request has been pending your approval for  58 days.

The beginning of Section 6.3 states \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?\".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of \"a single sum distribution\" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.\n\nTom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.\n\nPhillip  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tOxley, David  \nSent:\tMonday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AM\nTo:\tAllen, Phillip K.\nCc:\tWhalley, Greg; Joyce, Mary\nSubject:\tAnswer \n\nFor purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a \"single sum distribution,\" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  \n\nSection 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.\n\nAdditionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \n\n      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\n", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/420."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <7232469.1075862163190.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:48:41 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: customerservice@tdwaterhouse.com\nTo: pallen@enron.com\nSubject: Market Insight: We See Upswing Continuing\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: TD Waterhouse <customerservice@tdwaterhouse.com>@ENRON\nX-To: pallen@enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n [IMAGE]  Market  Insight for November 26, 2001  From    [IMAGE]    The  Gl=\nobal Online Financial Services Firm   Introducing  Goldman Sachs PrimeAcces=\nssm Research  As a TD Waterhouse customer,  you now have online access to G=\noldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm  Research.

We  See Upswing Con=\ntinuing   By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   Selective  accumulation r=\nemains in order.  The  early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary wi=\ndely in degree.  As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become f=\nar less  dramatic.   Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early b=\necause of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to =\nSeptember 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That's about average for rebounds =\nin  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this =\nweek's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries fr=\nom the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won ba=\nck an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine insta=\nnces, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two mo=\nnths and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six =\nmonths. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovere=\nd after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in=\n a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but tha=\nt's typically  the case in the early part of a bull market that is associat=\ned  with an economic recession. Stock prices start recovering well  before =\nthe headlines improve. The September upturn in stocks would  be consistent =\nwith the start of an economic expansion in the first  quarter of next year.=\n   While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won't necessarily keep the  b=\null market from progressing. The preceding economic expansion  was the long=\nest in history and gave rise to \"new era\"  optimism. Corporations, especial=\nly in information technology,  built production and sales capacity to level=\ns far greater than  proved justified. Those excesses are now being correcte=\nd, painfully.  Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the eco=\nnomy  begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and P/Es will  st=\nart looking much more reasonable. Low inflation, low interest  rates, rapid=\n technological innovation and above-average productivity  growth should hel=\np support elevated stock valuations.

Now comes a new version\n         of its iTunes digital jukebox software, which\n         really takes the cake. Josh and John tell you\n         why these Apple products--and a slew of other\n         gizmos to pass through ZDNet Labs this week--scored\n         so well with our editors.\n\n\nhttp://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1221/2834197:8593142\n\n\n\t\t\t> > > > >\n\n\nPreston Gralla\n\n\n   HOW TO MASTER WINDOWS (AT LEAST WHERE YOU CAN)\n\n   You can't fix all of Windows' idiosyncrasies,\n         but you can at least control how it behaves\n         when it starts up and shuts down.

Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. \n\nObviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.\nOne question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM \"core\" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nYevgeny Frolov\n713-345-8250 w\n << File: BRM Cash Flow Cases.xls >>  << File: BRM Contingency Numbers Rev3.xls >> ", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/435."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <28340245.1075862163596.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 7 Jan 2018 11:10:59 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: mery.l.brown@accenture.com\nTo: pallen@enron.com\nSubject: Summary of Today's Meeting\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: mery.l.brown@accenture.com@ENRON\nX-To: pallen@enron.com\nX-cc: donald.l.barnhart@accenture.com, kmcdani@enron.com, Frolov, Yevgeny </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=YFROLOV>\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nPhillip,\n\nHere are the key points that came out of today's meeting:\n\n1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the\nKnowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type.\n\n2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content\nfor these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next\nweek to gather content and a second meeting for review.\n\n3. We will change \"Gas Daily Risk\" to \"Intra-Month Risk\" throughout the\nsimulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?\n\n4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems\nwhere there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to\nhedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil\nvolumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?\n\nThank you in advance for your help.

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).

The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \n\n      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\n", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/449."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <32182664.1075855375988.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 21 Feb 2018 14:30:49 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: e-mail.center@wsj.com\nTo: business_alert@listserv.dowjones.com\nSubject: NEWS ALERT: Argentina's President Resigns\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"WSJ.com Editors\" <e-mail.center@WSJ.COM>\nX-To: BUSINESS_ALERT@LISTSERV.DOWJONES.COM\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Jan2002_1\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n__________________________________\nBUSINESS ALERT\nfrom The Wall Street Journal\n\n\nDec. 20, 2001\n\nArgentina's president resigned, a high-ranking official said.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =\nadministrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=\n.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =\na hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =\n =20\n\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=\n same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=\ner.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPhillip Allen   =20\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/452."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <23536814.1075862164055.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 19 Feb 2018 13:17:16 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: ryan.o'rourke@enron.com\nTo: k..allen@enron.com, eric.bass@enron.com, frank.ermis@enron.com, \n\tl..gay@enron.com, mike.grigsby@enron.com, mog.heu@enron.com, \n\tkeith.holst@enron.com, jason.huang@enron.com, kam.keiser@enron.com, \n\ttori.kuykendall@enron.com, matthew.lenhart@enron.com, \n\tstephanie.miller@enron.com, ryan.o'rourke@enron.com, \n\tjay.reitmeyer@enron.com, susan.lindberg@enron.com, \n\tmatt.smith@enron.com, p..south@enron.com, m..tholt@enron.com, \n\thouston <.ward@enron.com>, mark.whitt@enron.com, \n\tjason.wolfe@enron.com\nSubject: TRV Notification:  (West NG Prices - Basis - 11/27/2001)\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: O'Rourke, Ryan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ROROURKE>\nX-To: Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pallen>, Bass, Eric </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ebass>, Ermis, Frank </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fermis>, Gay, Randall L. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rgay>, Grigsby, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgrigsb>, Heu, Mog </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mheu>, Holst, Keith </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kholst>, Huang, Jason </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jhuang>, Keiser, Kam </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kkeiser>, Kuykendall, Tori </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tkuyken>, Lenhart, Matthew </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mlenhar>, Miller, Stephanie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Smiller2>, O'Rourke, Ryan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rorourke>, Reitmeyer, Jay </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jreitme>, Lindberg, Susan </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Slindber>, Smith, Matt </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Msmith18>, South, Steven P. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ssouth>, Tholt, Jane M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jtholt>, Ward, Kim S (Houston) </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kward>, Whitt, Mark </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mwhitt>, Wolfe, Jason </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jwolfe>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nThe report named: West NG Prices - Basis <http://trv.corp.enron.com/linkFromExcel.asp?report_cd=45&report_name=West+NG+Prices+-+Basis&category_cd=2&category_name=WEST&toc_hide=1&sTV1=2&TV1Exp=Y&current_efct_date=11/27/2001>, published as of 11/27/2001 is now available for viewing on the website.", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/453."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <10046314.1075862164077.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 8 Jan 2018 12:56:45 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: tim.o'rourke@enron.com\nTo: k..allen@enron.com\nSubject: BRM module\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: O'rourke, Tim </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TOROURKE>\nX-To: Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pallen>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\PALLEN (Non-Privileged)\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nPhillip,\n\nI know that Yevgeny has been keeping you upto speed with the options we have on the BRM deal.

You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. \n\n\nAll Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.  \n\nParking & Transportation Desk\n3-7060", "file": "allen-p/deleted_items/5."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <22066774.1075855376103.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sat, 10 Mar 2018 08:43:22 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: e-mail.center@wsj.com\nTo: tech_alert@listserv.dowjones.com\nSubject: TECH ALERT: The Year in Technology 2001\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"WSJ.com Editors\" <e-mail.center@WSJ.COM>\nX-To: TECH_ALERT@LISTSERV.DOWJONES.COM\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Jan2002_1\\Allen, Phillip K.\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n__________________________________\nTECHNOLOGY ALERT\nfrom The Wall Street Journal\n\n\nThursday, Dec. 20, 2001\n\nA long slump battered technology companies this year, but the Internet's\nrole in everyday life continued to grow.

It  represents a comprehensive improv=\nement over its Jimmy predecessor, making  it one of the most competitive mi=\nd-sized SUVs on the market.   The fact that it is still \"truck-based\" - whi=\nch essentially refers to the  full-frame construction that makes its Yukon =\nbig brother such a beefy  workhorse - does not mean that this SUV rides lik=\ne a truck. Quite the  contrary, the Envoy is smooth and refined in a way th=\nat would have been  unthinkable just a few years ago. Of course, the market=\n in which the Envoy  competes has become packed with excellent choices, wit=\nh everyone from Acura  to Mercury entering the fray.

Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, \nBoise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude \nawakening in the next 2-3 years.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 \n03:41 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  John D Suarez                           09/05/2000 01:45 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Dana Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul J \nBroderick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey Miller/NA/Enron@Enron\ncc:  \nSubject: \n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by John D Suarez/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 01:46 \nPM ---------------------------\n\n\nGeorge Hopley\n09/05/2000 11:41 AM\nTo: John D Suarez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Suresh Vasan/Enron Communications@ENRON \nCOMMUNICATIONS@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: \n\nInternet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on\n                  Local Utilities \n\n                  ( September 05, 2000 ) \n\n\n                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus\n                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in \nTukwila. \n\n                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and \ncomputer servers for the\n                  region's growing number of dot-coms. \n\n                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up \nconstruction\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \na mile from its\n                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \nfiber optic backbones, the\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \neventually\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \n\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \ncenters near Seattle.\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \nGlobix and\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \nthe networking\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \n\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \neverything from your\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \nyour favorite Web sites.\n\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \nserver farms, are\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \nValley that some\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \nPuget Sound\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \nhigh-security\n                  facilities. \n\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \nare requesting 445\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \nsaid Karl\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \nEnergy. \"That is\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \n\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \nthe rise of the Internet\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \nheads. \n\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \nUtilities and\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \ndata centers. The\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing \nresidential and business\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \nnecessary to support\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \nmillion each,\n                  Karzmar said. \n\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \nbring up the data center\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \n\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \nbusinesses and schools in the\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \n\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \nappetite for power --\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \nfacilities run 24 hours a\n                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \nconstant revenue\n                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \nthey could\n                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \nexpenditures. \n\n                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \nmean for power rates\n                  in the area is still open to debate. \n\n                       \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \nloads,\" said Bob Royer,\n                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \nCity Light. \n\n                       \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \nlights at the football\n                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \nWe have data\n                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \nand 50 megawatts.\" \n\n                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \ncomplex in Tukwila is\n                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \nthe 1.35 million\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \nBoeing Space &\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \n92 percent of the\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \ncompanies. \n\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \nCommunications,\n                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \nNetworks all\n                  lease space in the office park. \n\n                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \nSabey has become an\n                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \nmanagement or\n                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \nclaims his firm is\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \nthe country. \n\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \nbandwidth-heavy tasks\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \nco-location space in\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \n\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \nspace is growing at a\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \ncausing similar\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \nCalifornia. \n\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \nspace, plans to nearly\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \nWhile companies\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \nhigh-tech companies\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \nas Exodus that\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \nmanagement. \n\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \nconstruction and we plan to\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \ndemand right now\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \nexecutive at Exodus in\n                  Seattle. \n\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \nin the local utility\n                  industry perplexed. \n\n                       \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \nto serve the growth,\"\n                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is \nalmost stunned by this, in\n                  a way.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/123."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <9237607.1075855675977.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 18 Mar 2018 06:04:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nIna,\n\n I scheduled a meeting with Jean Mrha tomorrow at 3:30", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/124."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <115086.1075855676000.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sat, 10 Mar 2018 07:00:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: retwell@sanmarcos.net\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: retwell@sanmarcos.net\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLarry,\n\n Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development \nopportunities.\n\n I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were \nbuilt by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for \n around $2 million.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.

Now or for the land closing? Investment \nschedule?\n\n Investment Return\n\n Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?\n\n Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits \nare distributed?\n\n Debt\n\n Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral \nis associated with each \n loan?\n\n Improvement\n\n Construction\n\n Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.\n\n Terms of each loan?\n\n Uses of Funds\n\n How will disbursements be made?  By whom?\n\n What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing \nfor investors?\n\n Reports to track expenses vs plan?\n\n Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\n\n What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get \npaid a markup on subcontractors as a \n general contractor and paid gain out of profits?\n\n Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses \nbefore the ultimate payout of profits?\n\n Design and Construction\n \n When will design be complete?\n\n What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?\n\n What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction \nplanning and permitting?\n\n Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, \nvendors, and other professionals? \n Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?\n\n Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to \nuse? Names?\n\nThese questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor \nin a project like this it is new to me.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/166."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <2304437.1075855676934.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 6 Apr 2018 07:50:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: andy.zipper@enron.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Andy Zipper\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nAndy,\n\n I spoke to John L. and he ok'd one of each new electronic system for the \nwest desk.

Note that the\nconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\nstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio\nof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.\n\nAlso, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs\nare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\nactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\nwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\n\nIt appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly\nsure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.\n\nI hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are\n$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3\nbedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached\ngarages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/185."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <17966419.1075855677350.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 17 Apr 2018 09:48:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: pallen70@hotmail.com\nSubject: rent roll\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: pallen70@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/28/2000 \n05:48 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"Lucy Gonzalez\" <stagecoachmama@hotmail.com> on 11/28/2000 01:02:22 PM\nTo: pallen@enron.com\ncc:  \nSubject: rent roll\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n_______\nGet more from the Web.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\nBut that still wasn't enough juice.\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\n$250/MWh price cap.\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\nPowerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\nWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\nwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\nDorinson said.\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\nElectric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\nthe high-priced power.\nSoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\nwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\nnearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail\ncustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity\nrates or if companies will absorb the costs.\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay\nPwr Plant\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent\nSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy\nCorp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,\nWednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.\nThe ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state\nsince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the\nreasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nAbout 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,\n7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the\nISO.\nThe ISO manages grid reliability.\nAs previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert\nat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would\ndip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid\ncollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling\nblackouts.\nThe ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),\nReliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).\nDuke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives\nin June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.\n\n\n   -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line\nPower Plants\n(This article was originally published Wednesday)\n\n   By Jessica Berthold\n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said\nWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by\nsome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate\nreasons.\nThe California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power\ngrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public\nUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power\nplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,\nISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.\nThe state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for\nunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency\nfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and\ncustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be\ncalled on to do so.\nAs reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)\nsaid they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday\nevening.\nRepresentatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES\nand Dynegy Tuesday evening.\nAES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection\nof the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday\nmorning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron\nThomas said.\nThomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives\nreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.\n\n   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits\n\nThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have\nused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down\ntwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality\nManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,\nThomas said.\nAES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire\nHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\nand Redondo Beach plants.\nThe ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\nhas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\ncompany $20 million for polluting.\n\"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\"\nThomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\ndistrict's\" authority.\nAs reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\ncould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\nline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\n\n   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\n\nDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday\nevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line\nWednesday.\n\"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you\nneed to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegy\nspokesman Lynn Lednicky.\nLednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and\nthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could\npose a safety hazard if not repaired.\n\"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We\neven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"\nLednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of\nwhy its units were off line.\n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,\njessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00\n1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n\n\nG_nther A.

Moore)\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nFolks,\n\nI just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and\ndevelopment of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I\nthink will be interesting to the group.\n\nI highly recommend David Moore's book \"The Roman Pantheon\" at $25.00  -   a\nvery thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime\nand clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book\ncovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.\n\nI find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -\ninteresting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years\nlearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,\nstructures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have\nlasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good\nbackground information for sustainable builder folks.\n\nThank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.\n\n <A HREF=\"http://www.romanconcrete.com/\">Roman Concrete Research by David\nMoore</A>\n\n\nRegards,\n\nHarry Francis", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/22."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <5034633.1075855678118.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 5 Feb 2018 08:04:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: critical.notice@enron.com\nTo: ywang@enron.com, patti.sullivan@enron.com, phillip.k.allen@enron.com, \n\tjane.m.tholt@enron.com, mike.grigsby@enron.com\nSubject: New Notice from Transwestern Pipeline Co.\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: critical.notice@Enron.com\nX-To: ywang@Enron.com, Patti.Sullivan@Enron.com, Phillip.K.Allen@Enron.com, jane.m.tholt@Enron.com, Mike.Grigsby@Enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nTranswestern Pipeline Co. posted new notice(s) since our last check at \n12/13/2000 3:30:01 PM, the newest notice looks like:\n\n Capacity Constraint, Dec 13 2000  4:03PM, Dec 14 2000  9:00AM, Dec 15 2000  \n8:59AM, 2241, Allocation - San Juan Lateral\n\nPlease click the following to go to the web site for detail.\n\nhttp://ios.ets.enron.com/infoPostings/shared/et_noncritical_notice.asp?company\n=60", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/220."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <26369292.1075855678139.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 17 Apr 2018 06:04:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: aod@newsdata.com\nTo: western.price.survey.contacts@ren-9.cais.net\nSubject: Special report coming from NewsData\nCc: alb@cpuc.ca.gov\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nBcc: alb@cpuc.ca.gov\nX-From: \"Arthur O'Donnell\" <aod@newsdata.com>\nX-To: Western.Price.Survey.contacts@ren-9.cais.net\nX-cc: \"'alb@cpuc.ca.gov'\" <alb@cpuc.ca.gov>\nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nOur Sacramento correspondent just exited a news conference from\nGov.

In the Southwest\ntemperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.\n     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell\n$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.\n     \"What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were\nsupposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the\nweather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.\"\n     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,\nand are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.\n     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the\nEl Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.\n     \"Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices\nto fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.\n     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased\n$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell\nto $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.\n     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant\nwas shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled\nto restart this weekend.\n     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at\n$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.\n\n-Robert Scalabrino\n\n\nPJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas\n\n     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day\npower prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New\nJersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and\nfalling natural gas prices, traders said.\n     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western\nPJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades\nranging from $62.00-$76.00.\n     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.\nforecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees\nFahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures\ncould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.\n     \"Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of\nthe morning,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"By options expiration\nthe market had pretty much dried up.\"\n     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main\nreason for the decline in spot market prices.\n     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the\nNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million\nBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since\nMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of\n$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts\nindicated reduced utility load requirements.\n     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they\nnormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather\nforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.\n     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13\nhigher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the\n$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-\n$92.00.\n     ~\n-Karyn Rispoli\n\n\nMid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices\n\n     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent\nnext-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised\nwarmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.\n     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the\nCincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19\nto $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the\nmarket opened down to $59.00 after options expired.\n     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on\nthe Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower\non average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17\nlower at $65.00-$100.00.\n     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted\nhigh temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal\nin Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven\ndays, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.\n     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled\nprices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent\nelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired\ngeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.\n     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average\nof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British\nthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average\nof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.\n     \"The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got\npeople coming to their senses,\" one trader said. \"These are much\nmore realistic prices.\"\n     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the\noutlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for\ndelivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00\nyesterday.\n     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged\nwith warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission\ncapacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in\nsouthern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.\n     \"What's happening is the people who don't have firm\ntransmission are getting into the market early and buying at those\nhigh prices since they have no choice,\" one MAPP trader said.\n     \"Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a\nfirm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices\nfell off,\" he said, \"and bought from them at those lower prices,\ncausing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.\"\n\n-Ken Fahnestock\n\n\nSoutheast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast\n\n     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast\nU.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was\nforecast for the region this week, traders said.\n     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since\nmany large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures\nclimb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.\n     \"There was nothing going on in Florida today,\" said one\nsouthern energy trader. \"Everything was going to markets in the\nnorth.\"\n     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into\nmarkets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority\ngrid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.\n     \"Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as\nforecasts came out,\" said on Entergy power trader. \"Prices,\ndeclined to $60 and less.\"\n     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95\nto $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades\nwere noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent\nestimates.\n     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather\nforecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week\ncaused prices to decline in the region.\n     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was\nthe main culprit behind lower prices.\n     \"The cold weather's backing off,\" said one SPP utility\ntrader. \"It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and\ntoday it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was\nbitter cold and today it was just plain cold.\"\n     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though\nthe Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern\nSPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.\n\n-Brian Whary\n\n\n\nU.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand\n\n     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in\nthe U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to\nincrease household consumption for space heating, traders said.\n     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the\nElectricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01\npounds a megawatt-hour.\n     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees\nto 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services\nCorp. in the U.S.\n     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15\npounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.\n     December continued to fall amid a combination of position\nclosing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will\nnot rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.\n     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.\n     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with\nexpectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue\nto stifle demand, traders said.\n     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.\n     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.\n     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer\n2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.\nWinter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour.\n     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely\nforce many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-\nup to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will\nprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more\neasily be assessed.\n\n-Nick Livingstone\n\n\nNordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast\n\n     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices\non the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today\nas colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.\n     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-\nhour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076\nmegawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446\nmegawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.\n     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after\nforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for\nnext week. These producers typically generate power to prevent\nreservoirs from overflowing.\n     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise\nwith falling temperatures because of increased requirements for\nspace heating.\n     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active\ntrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders\nsaid.\n     \"The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,\" a\nStockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have been\nselling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should\nnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"\n     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall\nbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited\nchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather\nServices Corp. in the U.S.\n     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was\nexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict\ntemperatures to begin falling.\n     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22\npercent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell\n4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.\n     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise\nby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.\n     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-\nterm contracts.\n     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,\n1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a\nmegawatt-hour.\n     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although\nexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers\nto meet the increased demand, other traders said.\n     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,\nwill delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.\n     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used\ntoday's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.\n\n-Nick Livingstone\n-0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT\n=0F$\n\n\n - daily.pdf", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/224."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <12753773.1075855678417.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 20 Mar 2018 08:22:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: rebecca.cantrell@enron.com\nTo: stephanie.miller@enron.com, ruth.concannon@enron.com, jane.tholt@enron.com, \n\ttori.kuykendall@enron.com, randall.gay@enron.com, \n\tphillip.allen@enron.com, timothy.hamilton@enron.com, \n\trobert.superty@enron.com, colleen.sullivan@enron.com, \n\tdonna.greif@enron.com, julie.gomez@enron.com\nSubject: Final Filed Version -- SDG&E Comments\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;

If \nyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as recommendations, here is a short list:\n\n 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales \nabove monthly index without enough consideration of future \n      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \ninjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\n                    This creates a shortage in later months.\n\n 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \ndemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  \n                      Specific questions should include:  \n\n  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order \nto fill storage?\n\n  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \nmuch gas from Socal's system.  \n       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their \nown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than \ntheir injection capablity, but injected far less.\n\n 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short \nterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major \n                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating \nrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market \nand the \n     consumer has benefitted.  \n\n\nCall me if you need any more input.\n\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/378."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <12302226.1075855707785.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 14 Feb 2018 04:43:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jsmith@austintx.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: jsmith@austintx.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nJeff,\n\nEverything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.

The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in \nSan Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a \ncouple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like \nto find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not \nrequire the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to \nstructure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has \nbeen mentioned is to obtain a \"forward commitment\" in order to reduce the \nequity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this \nnature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to \npermanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be \nimportant to banks. \n\n I am faxing you a project summary.

In attendance were Ken Lay, \nthe Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \nproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \nbased on the governor's comments:\n\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \nthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \nwas a frequently recurring theme.\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \nbasis to consumers.\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \nCalifornia.\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \nwidely deploy distributed generation.\nExpand in-state gas production.\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \naddtional gas supplies.\nEmpower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \nmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \nany one time.\nCondition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\nEither eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \nmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be \nable to help out here).\nWants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \nsome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \nsome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \nthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \napproach with generators.\nSecuritize uncollected power purchase costs.\nTo dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's \nthoughts and get them to Kari)\nHe wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \nnot just the 5 one year strips.\nHe wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\nHe would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \ndeal.\nHe wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \nforward contracting issues.\nThanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/384."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <31627242.1075855707917.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 30 Mar 2018 01:36:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: keith.holst@enron.com\nSubject: New Generation, Nov 30th\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Keith Holst\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/02/2001 \n09:34 AM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Tim Belden                           12/05/2000 06:42 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: New Generation, Nov 30th\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Tim Belden/HOU/ECT on 12/05/2000 05:44 AM \n---------------------------\n\nKristian J Lande\n\n12/01/2000 03:54 PM\n\nTo: Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jake Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank W \nVickers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Elliot Mainzer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael McDonald/SF/ECT@ECT, \nDavid Parquet/SF/ECT@ECT, Laird Dyer/SF/ECT@ECT, Jim Buerkle/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jim \nGilbert/PDX/ECT@ECT, Terry W Donovan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff G \nSlaughter/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ed Clark/PDX/ECT@ECT, Saji \nJohn/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert \nBadeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mike Swerzbin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Todd \nPerry/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey Oh/PDX/ECT@ECT \nSubject: New Generation, Nov 30th\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/385."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <23313935.1075855707939.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sun, 1 Apr 2018 06:41:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: gallen@thermon.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: gallen@thermon.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nQuestions about 12/29 rentroll:\n\n There were two deposits that were not labeled.

Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\n\"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, \na trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \n\nBut the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\n\"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting,\" McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \nfingers at Wall Street. \n\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for \nthe rise in gas prices. \n\n\"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \n\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \n\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \nfor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \n\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \nprices before they soared. \n\n\"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \n\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \n\n\"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \nchange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \n\n\nHot topic \n\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \nmany circles, little else is discussed. \n\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \nprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \ncustomers. \n\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \nfor winter. \n\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \nmarkets. \n\n\"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \ncommodity in the world. \n\n\nSetting the price \n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \nwidespread influence over gas prices. \n\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \n\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \nof natural gas. \n\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \ntheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \nin a short time. \n\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \nweekly storage numbers. \n\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \nneed in the winter. \n\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \nhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \n\nStill, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \nsufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \nassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n\nBut some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n\n\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n\nThen suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \nWednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n\n\nJust passing through \n\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \npass their fuel costs on to customers. \n\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \nenergy. \n\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \n\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \ncosts. \n\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \n\n\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider \nsome changes.\" \n\n\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \nseverly@kcstar.com. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star  ", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/400."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <19962240.1075855708274.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Sat, 13 Jan 2018 06:06:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: john.lavorato@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Response to PGE request for gas\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: John J Lavorato\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/22/2001 \n02:06 PM ---------------------------\nFrom: Travis McCullough on 01/22/2001 01:48 PM CST\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Response to PGE request for gas\n\nDraft response to PGE -- do you have any comments?\n\nTravis McCullough\nEnron North America Corp.\n1400 Smith Street EB 3817\nHouston Texas 77002\nPhone:  (713) 853-1575\nFax: (713) 646-3490      \n----- Forwarded by Travis McCullough/HOU/ECT on 01/22/2001 01:47 PM -----\n\n\tWilliam S Bradford\n\t01/22/2001 01:44 PM\n\t\t\n\t\t To: Travis McCullough/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: Re: Response to PGE request for gas\n\nWorks for me.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially \ncomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with \nthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of \nwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who \nswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the \nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \n(and maybe earlier).\n\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \nForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get \nsome assurances of payment. \n\nSCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due \non 2/2/01.\n\nFor gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's \npurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements \n(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be \nresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this \noccurred today.\n\nStatus of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will \nhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  \nPlan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but \ncould be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule \nmust be discussed and agreed upon.\n\nFeel free to call me at home (713)463-8626\n\n\nPhillip\n \n \n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/410."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <10028000.1075855708497.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 2 Jan 2018 07:26:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: pallen70@hotmail.com\nSubject: RE:Stock Options\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: pallen70@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/29/2001 \n03:26 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"Stephen Benotti\" <stephen.benotti@painewebber.com> on 01/29/2001 11:24:33 AM\nTo: \"'pallen@enron.com'\" <pallen@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: RE:Stock Options\n\n\n\nPhillip here is the information you requested.\n\nShares  Vest date Grant Price\n4584  12-31-01 18.375\n3200\n 1600 12-31-01 20.0625\n 1600 12-31-02 20.0625\n9368\n 3124 12-31-01 31.4688\n 3124 12-31-02 31.4688\n 3120 12-31-03 31.4688\n5130\n 2565 1-18-02  55.50\n 2565 1-18-03  55.50\n7143\n 2381 8-1-01  76.00\n 2381 8-1-02  76.00\n 2381 8-1-03  76.00\n24\n 12 1-18-02  55.50\n 12 1-18-03  55.50\n\n\nNotice Regarding Entry of Orders and Instructions: Please\ndo not transmit orders and/or instructions regarding your\nPaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.

Cash Needs\nHighlights:\nSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\nplete=20\ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\ns=20\nand other measures.=20\nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\n.8=20\nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\nII. Credit Relationships\nHighlights:\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\nSCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\nlt.=20\nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\nnd=20\npayable.\nSCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\n=20\nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\nits=20\nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\n=20\nissues within the last three weeks.\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\nHighlights\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\nvarious price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\n such=20\nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\nHighlights\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\n=20\nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\nTotal                                             $ 460\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\n=20\nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\nom=20\ncontract employees.\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\n=20\nmost part being deferred to a future date.\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\nsavings of approximately $92 million.\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\nActivity)\nHighlights:\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\n=20\nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\ne=20\nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\n=20\nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\nD.01-01-018.\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA.

I have shifted \nto a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could \nnot work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more \ntowards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One \nwing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 \nkid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + \nguestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This \nplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the \ncourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor \nliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. \n The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass \nskylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have \nsingle slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  \n\nI don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would \nlike to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I \nwould like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I \nwould like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we \ndidn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. \n\nCall or email to let me know if this would work for you.  \npallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)\n\n\nPhillip Allen\n\n\nPS.

There are several \nreasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the \nlarge cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer \nare the three biggest concerns.  \n\nWhat I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the \nbuyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due \nuntil September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the \nproperty.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make \nthe deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance \nis pushing too far.\n\nCan you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the \nearnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?\n\nHopefully the buyer can live with these terms.

Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate\n\n2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million\n\n3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.\n\n4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?\n\n5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.\n\nWith regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a \nsolid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes \ncosts.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I \nwould like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax \nall invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the \nchecking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing \nbut invoices were not being submitted.\n\nLet me know if you can draft these agreements.

Sorry it is so late.\n\n\n\nThere are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.\n\n1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank \nis showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the \nspreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.\n\n2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?\n\n3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?\n\n4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?\n\n5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?\n\n6.  #14  missed on 2/2?\n\n7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?\n\n8.  #20a missed on 2/2?\n\n9.  #35 missed on 2/2?\n\nMy guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  \nYou may have sent me a message over the \"chat\" line that I don't remember on \nsome of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the \nbank deposit.\n\nWill have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade \nlast night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.\n\nI believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet \nthem?

I will set up a room with Kim.\n\nHere are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:\n\n1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, \nTAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the \n       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and \nTAGG but the issues facing \n       scheduling in Unify are grey.\n\n2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the \"assume it is messed up\" \npolicy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need \nfurther      scrutiny.\n\n3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical \nimbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?\n\n4.

Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) \nwill\nbe in the range of 75% - 80%.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \n500+\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \nthis,\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\n\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\n\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\n\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\n\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\nturn over.\n\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\n\n4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \ndebt\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\n\n5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\n\n6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\nequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\n\n     Land -                   $1,121,670\n     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\n     Cash Equity              $1,419,268\n     Total                    $2,955,938\n\n7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage \nof\nactual hard construction costs.\n\n(See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)\n\n\n\n\n - MAPTTRA.xls\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/467."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <3039085.1075855709869.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 23 Feb 2018 06:46:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: ina.rangel@enron.com\nTo: information.management@enron.com\nSubject: Mike Grigsby\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Ina Rangel\nX-To: Information Risk Management\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nPlease approve Mike Grigsby for Bloomberg.  \n\nThank You,\nPhillip Allen", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/468."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <8056377.1075855709890.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 8 Feb 2018 05:06:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nLucy, \n\nHere is a rentroll for this week.  \n\nWhat is the outstanding balance on #1.

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is \nstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot \nand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a \ntopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to \ncoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the \nsmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going \nto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to \ncomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which \n$14,000 are due now for work completed.  \n\nWe are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by \nthe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can \ncontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's \nnumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and \nask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call \nand he was fine with that.  \n\nNow we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp \nFlores can be used.\n\nKeith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very \noptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.\n\nCall me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about \nmoving this project forward.\n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/475."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <22647397.1075855710047.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 1 Mar 2018 08:01:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: pallen70@hotmail.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: pallen70@hotmail.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/14/2001 \n04:01 PM ---------------------------\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Phillip K Allen                           03/14/2001 09:49 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Jacquestc@aol.com\ncc:  \nSubject: \n\nHere is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format.

According to BPA,\nit had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet\nbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in\norder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had\nbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that the\nsales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.\n\nCal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than\nyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.\nYesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because\nof concerns about its water reserves.

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/50."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <1550172.1075855710578.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 11 Jan 2018 08:03:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: rlehmann@yahoo.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: rlehmann@yahoo.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nReagan,\n\nThank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a \nlist of questions on the specs:\n\n1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less \nand cost about the same?\n\n2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory \njoist?\n\n3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?\n\n4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What \ntype of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or \nCellulose?\n\n5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?\n\n6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know \nthe difference between an apron and a stool.\n\n7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent \ncracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?\n\n8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial \none out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.\n\n9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under \nthe stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.\n\n10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount \nstainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.\n\n11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.\n\n12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?\n\n13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?\n\n14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron \nrailings?\n\n15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except \nfor change orders?\n\nI want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but \nthis is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to \ncall Cary Kipp to\nsee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.\n\nPhillip\nI\n\n ", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/500."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <15517078.1075855710600.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 30 Mar 2018 01:41:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: scsatkfa@caprock.net\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: scsatkfa@caprock.net\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nCary,\n\nHere is the picture of the house I have in mind.

I have also attached an \nextremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even \nreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only \ngenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about \nsuch a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down \nto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.

Center Garage\n\nThe Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.\n\nEmployees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new \nbuilding and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being \noffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.\n\nThis is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the \nnew garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The \ncost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is \ncurrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly \nemployee cost of $94.00.\n\nIf you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to \nthe Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made \nas spaces become available. \n\nThe Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be \nopened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street \nlevel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. \nGarage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an \nexit in the event of elevator trouble. \n\nIf you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to \nParking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your \nemail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and \nreceive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new \ngarage.\n\nThe Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and \nTransportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. \n\n(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, \nwill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/507."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <30506307.1075855710760.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 17 Apr 2018 01:53:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: jacquestc@aol.com\nSubject: \nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: jacquestc@aol.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nJacques,\n\nThe assets and liabilities that we are willing to assume are listed below:\n\nAssets:\n\nLand\nPreliminary Architecture Design-Kipp Flores Architects\nPreliminary Engineering-Cuatro Consultants, Ltd.\nSoils Study-Kohutek Engineering & Testing, Inc.\nAppraisal-Atrium Real Estate Services\n\n\nLiabilities:\n\nNote to Phillip Allen\nOutstanding Invoices to Kipp Flores, Cuatro, and Kohutek\n\n\nAdditional Consideration or Concessions\n\nForgive interest due\nReimburse $3,500 for appraisal and $2,375 for partial payment to engineer\n\nLet me know if you need more detail.  \n\nPhillip", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/508."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <7795208.1075855710782.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 13 Feb 2018 00:19:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: ina.rangel@enron.com\nSubject: EES Gas Desk Happy Hour\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Ina Rangel\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\nDo you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders.\n\nPhillip\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/04/2001 \n07:11 AM ---------------------------\nTo: Fred Lagrasta/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott \nNeal/HOU/ECT@ECT, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES\ncc:  \nSubject: EES Gas Desk Happy Hour\n\nFred/Phillip/Scott:  We are having a happy hour at Sambuca this Thursday,  \nplease be our guests and invite anyone on your desks that would be interested \nin meeting some of the new gas desk team.\n\nhttp://www.americangreetings.com/pickup.pd?i=172082367&m=1891\n\n\nThank you,\n\nJess\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/509."}, {"message": "Message-ID: <25893724.1075855674380.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 4 Apr 2018 02:05:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: phillip.allen@enron.com\nTo: kenneth.shulklapper@enron.com\nSubject: Re: SW Gas\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Phillip K Allen\nX-To: Kenneth Shulklapper\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Phillip_Allen_Dec2000\\Notes Folders\\Discussion threads\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: pallen.nsf\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/28/2000 \n09:02 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nLaird Dyer\n04/27/2000 01:17 PM\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael McDonald/SF/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re: SW Gas  \n\nMike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.

We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we \nimplement our strategy in California.\n\nAre there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset \nmanagement deal that we should approach?

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \ncompared with the previous year.\n\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \nthink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \nrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \nnon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \nWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \n6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\n\nI am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \nwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \nhope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \nquestions or need any further information.\n", "file": "allen-p/discussion_threads/514."}]
